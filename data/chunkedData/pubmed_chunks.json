Over the last decade evidence has emerged supporting the positive impact that physical activity has on long-term conditions. Previous concerns were raised about the risks of hypoglycaemia in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) thus limiting participation in sports. Importantly, physical activity improves the metabolic profile, bone mineral density, cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin sensitivity while lowering mortality risk in children with T1DM.",

This review highlights approaches that can be used before, during and after exercise to mitigate the risk of hypoglycaemia. The approaches include the timing of exercise, the type of exercise, adjustments to insulin and carbohydrate, use of novel technology and education.",

Owing to these benefits, people with T1D are recommended to undertake regular physical activity, 150\u00a0min per week for adults and 60\u00a0min per day for children and adolescents. Despite the recommendations, many people do not meet these targets. One of the commonly cited barriers to exercise is fear of hypoglycaemia along with limited knowledge of effective preventative strategies. Hypoglycaemia can be difficult to predict, and symptoms are often masked during exercise or stress of competition.",

Hypoglycaemia before an event increases the risks of hypoglycaemia during competition and can reduce performance. To avoid hypoglycaemia, people with T1D may avoid exercise altogether or consume excessive amounts of carbohydrates, which mitigates many of the health benefits of exercise.

Different behaviour change processes are required for young people and for their parents and both are important to achieve physical activity participation.

Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood.

Meeting current physical activity guidelines by walking briskly for 30 min per day for 5 days can reduce the risk of several age-associated diseases.",

This mini review describes possible applications of CGM systems in healthy adults in health care, wellness, and sports. CGM systems can be used for early detection of abnormal glucose regulation. Learning from CGM data how the intake of foods with different glycemic loads and physical activity affect glucose responses can be helpful in improving nutritional and/or physical activity behavior.

Although the exact molecular mechanisms that depict this relationship remain unclear, there are indications that environmental factors such as eating, lifestyle habits, stress, and physical activity, influence our genes and modulate their function by epigenetic mechanisms to shape mental health outcomes. Epigenetic mechanisms act as crucial link between genes and environmental influences, proving that non-genetic factors could have enduring effects on the epigenome and influence health trajectories. We review studies that demonstrated an epigenetic mechanism of action of nutrition on mental health, focusing on the role of specific micronutrients during critical stages of brain development.",

What is the role of elevated demand in neural modulation of cardiovascular control in respiratory and locomotor skeletal muscle, and what are the mechanisms involved? What advances does it highlight? There is a sympathetic restraint of blood flow to locomotor muscles during near-maximal exercise, which might function to maintain blood pressure. During submaximal exercise, respiratory muscle blood flow might be also be reduced if ventilatory load is sufficiently high.

Thus, identifying the key internal skeletal muscle-derived variables that mediate the translation of external RE variables will be pivotal to determining the most effective strategies for skeletal muscle hypertrophy in healthy persons.",

Because exercise interventions in humans typically focus on chronic diseases, national fitness, and body weight loss, and typically have low intervention compliance rates, it is important to use mice models to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the health benefits from exercise interventions in humans.",

While clinician-oriented variables are helpful in describing the physiological recovery from injury, they neglect the patient perspective and aspects of patient-centered care. Variables that capture patient perspective are essential when considering the impact of injury and recovery on the lives of patients. The inclusion of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) as dependent variables in sports medicine research, including injury prevention and rehabilitation research, provides a unique perspective regarding the patient's perception of their health status, the effectiveness of treatments, and other information that the patient deems important to their care.",

Nevertheless, how older people react to day-to-day fluctuations of fatigue and whether fatigue plays a role in non-exercise physical activity compensation is not known.

GPs are limited by time often precluding the assessment of exercise levels in children and adolescents unless it is immediately relevant to their presentation.",

This training is believed to result in the same benefits as if the patients were training under high loads.

Previous concerns were raised about the risks of hypoglycaemia in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) thus limiting participation in sports. Importantly, physical activity improves the metabolic profile, bone mineral density, cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin sensitivity while lowering mortality risk in children with T1DM.",

Despite international treatment guidelines, poor asthma control remains a frequent problem leading to missed school and work, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Many patients with asthma report exercise as a trigger for their asthma, which likely leads to exercise avoidance as a means to control symptoms. Evolving research has suggested that routine exercise may actually help improve some aspects of asthma control. This review discusses the recent research addressing how routine exercise affects important asthma-related outcomes including symptoms, lung function and quality of life. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted in recent years, which strongly support the safety of routine exercise in children and adults with asthma.",

The primary aim of the IMPACT trial is to determine the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention compared with psychoeducation, in addition to routine clinical care, on depressive symptoms in young people. Additional aims are to evaluate the intervention effects on anxiety and functional outcomes and examine whether changes in physical activity mediate improvements in depressive symptoms.",

Therefore, the aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was to analyze the effects of walking in a suggested environment and free walking on physical activity levels in individuals with COPD.",

We also present the findings for the impact of each lifestyle factor. No studies examined diet, sleep, or meditation, and only two studies focused on smoking and alcohol consumption each.

To do so, exercise affects the central nervous system (CNS) at different levels. It changes brain physiology and structure, promoting cognitive improvements, which ultimately improves quality of life. Most of these effects are mediated by neurotrophins release, enhanced adult hippocampal neurogenesis, attenuation of neuroinflammation, modulation of cerebral blood flow, and structural reorganisation, besides to promote social interaction with beneficial cognitive outcomes.",

Meta-analytic reviews provide summary statistics relative to these effects when the cognitive task is performed while exercising and when performed after exercise. When performed concomitantly the effects of exercise are typically small or negative with the exception of moderate effects for speed of cognitive performance during moderate intensity exercise. When cognitive performance is assessed following the cessation of exercise, the effects are typically positive. When considering the effects following exercise, most studies have focused on executive function and episodic memory as the cognitive outcomes of interest with meta-analyses supporting small-to-moderate benefits.",

These observed benefits are likely due to the impacts acute exercise can have on physiological arousal, brain function, and brain neurotrophic factors. Advancements in our understanding of the potential of a single session of exercise to benefit cognitive performance are important for exercise prescription and to inform chronic exercise programs designed to benefit cognition.",
