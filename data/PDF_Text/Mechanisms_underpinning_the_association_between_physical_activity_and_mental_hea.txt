Doré et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2020 17:9 Open Access Mechanisms underpinning the association between physical activity and mental health in adolescence: a 6-year study Isabelle Doré1,2 Jennifer Brunet6 and Mathieu Bélanger7,8,9 , Benjamin Sylvester3, Catherine Sabiston4, Marie-Pierre Sylvestre5,2, Jennifer O’Loughlin5,2, Abstract Background: Physical activity PA can promote mental health, but the mechanisms underpinning this association are not well-established. This study examined if perceptions of three basic psychological needs autonomy, competence, relatedness and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity MVPA mediate the association between number of years participating in PA and mental health in adolescence. Methods: Participants included 937 children 55% female age 10–11 at inception of the longitudinal MATCH study, who provided data every 4 months over 6 years. Mediation analyses were used to assess the natural direct effect of number of years of PA participation cycles 1–15 during late childhood and adolescence on later mental health cycle 16, measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form MHC-SF, and the natural indirect effect through each of self-perceived autonomy, competence and relatedness, and self-report MVPA cycle 15. Results: In single mediator models, indirect effects of autonomy, competence, relatedness and self-report MVPA were statistically significant. In joint mediation models each of three models including one basic psychological need and MVPA, autonomy, competence and relatedness mediated 71, 27, and 51% of the association respectively; MVPA mediated 27–31% of the association. In the mediation model including all four mediators, relatedness mediated the largest proportion of the association, followed by autonomy and MVPA. Conclusion: Results support developing strategies to encourage adolescents to engage and remain involved in PA. This could foster perceptions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness as well as MVPA, which in turn may enhance mental health. Keywords: Physical activity, Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness, Well-being, Basic psychological needs Introduction Participation in physical activity PA and sport in youth has numerous physical and mental health benefits 1, 2. It contributes to positive youth development 1, 3 by providing opportunities to develop personal and social skills and by reinforcing self-esteem , self-efficacy and self-control . PA and sport provide a context for social integration by allowing participants to be socially connected and accepted as important by others, which Correspondence: 1School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada 2CHUM Research Centre, Montréal, Québec, Canada Full list of author information is available at the end of the article can positively impact mental health 7–9 especially when undertaken in a group or team setting . Most evidence to date on the benefits of PA focuses on mental illness rather than mental health, which is a positive psy- chological construct. Although mental health is inversely related to the risk of anxiety and depression, it is more than the absence of mental illness . Mental health is a multidimensional construct comprising emotional, psychological and social dimensions of well-being . Identifying mechanisms through which PA increase well-being among adolescents is critical to developing ef- fective targeted interventions to promote mental health and reduce mental disorders in youth. © The Authors. 2020 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2020 17:9 Basic psychological needs , defined as organismic necessities essential for psychological growth, integrity and wellness, represent psychosocial mechanisms by which the social environment impacts functioning and well-being . Satisfaction of the three main psycho- logical needs of autonomy feelings of volition and self- governing one’s own behaviour, choices and decisions , competence sense of mastery through effective interaction with the social environment and experien- cing opportunities in which to express one’s capabilities , and relatedness feeling a secure sense of belong- ingness and connectedness to others in one’s social en- vironment in social contexts predicts health and well-being outcomes 16, 17. In PA contexts, satisfac- tion of these needs is associated with enhanced engage- ment, performance and well-being in adolescents 18, 19. For example, satisfaction of basic psychological needs predicted increases in well-being in young female gymnasts in the US , and in elite adolescent athletes in Norway . In a longitudinal study of adolescent male soccer players, Balaguer et al. found that im- provements in satisfaction of basic psychological needs positively predicted changes in subjective vitality and was negatively related to burnout. When PA occurs within a cooperative structure, it can foster connections with others and feelings of volitional engagement , and it offers opportunities for enhanced competence if individuals within the group work together , provide feedback, support each other’s successes and build friendships . Youth consistently involved in PA during adolescence also report higher levels of self-report moderate-to- vigorous physical activity MVPA , and convincing evidence indicates increased benefits on mental health with higher self-report MVPA levels 27, 28. Consistent involvement in PA during chilhood and adolescence might impact mental health by increasing MVPA levels and/or by satisfying basic psychological needs. Thus, MVPA could represent another mechanism underpin- ning the benefit of PA on mental health. Using self-report measures, the first objective of this study was to investigate if perceptions of autonomy, competence, relatedness and/or MVPA in adolescence mediate the association between PA in childhood and early adolescence and mental health in later adolescence see Directed Acyclic Graph Fig. 1. Second, in joint models including two mediators we examined whether perceptions of each of autonomy, competence and re- latedness, in addition to MVPA, mediate the association between PA during childhood and early adolescence and mental health in later adolescence. Finally, in a 4- mediator model we examined the specific contribution of each potential mechanism. We hypothesized a direct effect of PA on mental health i.e., more years of PA is associated with better mental health in later adoles- cence. We also hypothesized that more years of PA is associated with enhanced perceptions of autonomy, competence and relatedness and higher levels of MVPA, which in turn, are associated with better mental health. We expected that perceptions of autonomy, competence and relatedness and MVPA explain part of the associ- ation. Results of this study could inform the develop- ment of PA interventions that promote mental health among adolescents. Methods Study population and procedures The sample included youth participating in MATCH Monitoring Activities of Teenagers to Comprehend their Habits study, an ongoing longitudinal study inves- tigating patterns of physical activity participation. A total of 806 children 51% of those eligible age 10.3 ± 0.6 Fig. 1 Directed Acyclic Graph representing the potential mediating effect of perceived autonomy, competence and relatedness specific to a PA context and MVPA, on the association between the number of years of PA participation and mental health Doré et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2020 17:9 years were recruited in the first year of the study from grade 5 and 6 classes in 17 schools in New Brunswick, Canada. Other students from the same schools joined the study in year 2 n = 39 and 4 n = 92, for a total of collected in self-report questionnaires every 4 months beginning in Fall 2011. For the current study, we used data collected over 6 years in the first 16 data collection cycles. All participants provided written informed assent and their parents provided written informed consent. A detailed study protocol is published elsewhere . Study variables Mental health Mental health was assessed using the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form MHC-SF , which com- prises 14 items measuring emotional 3 items, social 5 items and psychological 6 items well-being. Partici- pants rated how often they felt “this way” during the last month on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 never to 5 all the time. A total score range 0–70 was com- puted for overall well-being; higher scores indicate better mental health. Scores from the MHC-SF have been shown to be valid, reliable and sex-invariant in assessing positive mental health in a sample of Canadian adoles- cents and young adults . Scores on all three sub- scales of the MHC-SF had high internal consistency in MATCH Cronbach’s α 0.90 to 0.94, as did scores for the total scale α = 0.97. Physical activity participation PA participation was measured as free-time engagement in PA i.e., outside school gym/physical education class in a 36-item PA and sport checklist e.g. hockey, basket- ball, ice skating, kayaking, karate. This questionnaire is similar to other self-report questionnaires used at this age 31, 32; it assesses the frequency i.e., never, once a month or less, 2–3 times per month, once a week, 2–3 times per week, 3–4 times per week, almost every day and with whom i.e., alone, with friends, with parents/ siblings, or with an organized group, team each activity was undertaken. There are no standard methods to de- fine regular exposure to PA in the litterature. Based on previous work on sport profile categorization, authors suggest that regular engagement in a given sport over at least 8 months per year can be defined as year-round participation in that sport 33, 34. Similarly, in the present study, participants were categorized as engaging in PA for a given year yes, no if they reported partici- pating in at least one activity per week, for a minimum of two of the three cycles during the year. In previous work using MATCH data , minimum frequency of one time per week was compared to 2–3 times per week to define sport profile categorization, with no substantial differences in the findings. A variable was created to quantify whether participants reported participating in PA for a total of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 years. Autonomy The 7-item autonomy subscale of the Basic Psycho- logical Needs in Life Scale was used to assess per- ceived autonomy. Items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 not at all true to 7 very true. The original scale was adapted to the physical activity context by including the word “physical activity” with following instructions: “The following statements repre- sent different feelings people have when they engage in physical activity. Using the scale provided, please answer the following questions by considering how you typically feel when participating in physical activity.” An example of a revised item is: “when I participate in physical activ- ity, I feel like I can pretty much be myself”. Based on psy- chometric assessment using the first 9 cycles of MATCH data , the three negatively worded items from the Basic Psychological Needs in Life Scale were removed. Similar to previous reports in studies of adolescents , the internal reliability of the score was good in the MATCH database Cronbach’s α = 0.89. Competence Perceived competence was measured using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory which comprises six items scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 not at all true to 7 very true. The same adaptation and in- structions as for the autonomy scale were provided. An example of a revised item is: “I think I am pretty good at physical activity”. Similar to the autonomy scale, the one negatively worded item in the Intrinsic Motivation In- ventory scale was removed . Similar to previous re- ports in adolescents , our findings support the internal reliability of the score Cronbach’s α = 0.92. Relatedness The Relatedness to Others in Physical Activity Scale comprises 6 items e.g., “I feel like I am part of a group who share my goals” assessing perceived relatedness to others, with each item representing feelings people have when they engage in physical activity . While the Re- latedness to Others in Physical Activity Scale was devel- oped to assess perceptions of relatedness in physical activity contexts in adults , validity and reliability of the scores have been demonstrated in adolescents . In the present study, Cronbach’s α = 0.96. MVPA was assessed using a 2-item self-report measure developed specifically for adolescents . Participants were asked to read the following statement: “Physical Doré et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2020 17:9 swimming, soccer, basketball, activity is an activity that increases your heart rate and makes you get out of breath some of the time. Physical activity can be done in sports, playing with friends, or walking to school. Some examples of physical activity are running, brisk walking, rollerblading, biking, dancing, skateboarding, football, and surfing” and then asked: “Over the course of the week past 7 days, how many days were you physically active for a total of at least 60 minutes per day?” and “Over the course of a typical or usual week, how many days are you physically active for a total of at least 60 minutes per day?” Response options ranged from 0 to 7 days. The two items were averaged to estimate the number of days of self-report MVPA per week. Based on previous psychometric assessment, this measure is recommended to assess MVPA ; scores have moderate to high test- retest reliability intra-class correlation = .77 and mod- erate correlation with accelerometer-measured MVPA Pearson correlation = .40 in early adolescents have been reported . Covariates Mediation analysis based on the causal inference ap- proach relies on the assumption of no unmeasured con- the most founding . Based on the literature, important confounders of the associations between PA and mental health, between PA and each potential medi- ator, and between the mediators and mental health, in- cluded sex, age and income 46, 47. Previous mental health level could potentially confound the associations. However, no measure of mental health was available at baseline. Neighbourhood income was determined by matching 6-digit postal codes reported by participants, with the mean income of persons ≥15 years in 2011 in each participants’ neighbourhood, as proposed in the Na- tional Household Survey . Participants were grouped into neighbourhood income groupings using tertiles. Analysis Preliminary analyses comprised descriptive statistics to assess distributions, identify outliers and compute pro- portions, means and standard deviations. Mediation ana- lyses were then performed to identify mechanisms on the causal pathway between PA and mental health, using the counterfactual definition of the total effect TE that allows decomposition into natural direct NDE and nat- ural indirect NIE effects . The NDE expresses how much mental health would change if the number of years participating in PA increased by 1 with the media- tors set at the level they would have been in the absence of PA participation i.e., the value of self-report MVPA, autonomy, competence and relatedness when the num- ber of years of PA = 0. The NIE expresses how much the mental health score would change on average if the value of the mediators were changed from the level they would take when the number of years of PA = 0 to the level they would take if the number of years of PA = 1, while the number of years of PA is fixed at level 1, which is equivalent to suppressing the direct effect of PA. The mediated proportion of the association is expressed by the ratio NIE/TE . As a first step, four mediation models were estimated one for each mediator separ- ately. Then, three joint mediation models with two me- diators were estimated, including 1 perception of one basic psychological need i.e., autonomy, competence, or relatedness and 2 self-report MVPA as mediators. A joint mediation model including all four mediators i.e., 4-mediator model was estimated to distinguish the rela- tive importance of each mediator in the same model. Pure natural indirect effects PNIE, which represent the proportion of the association due to mediation only, spe- cific to each mediator included in the joint models, were identified using natural effect decomposition . Esti- mations were obtained in parametric models based on linear regressions. Exposure, mediators and the outcome were all modeled as continuous variables and the scores for mediator variables were standardized to facilitate in- terpretation of the results. To avoid reverse causation bias, we considered consecutive rather than concurrent measures: potential confounders cycle 1, exposure cycle 1 to 15, mediators cycle 15 and outcome cycle 16. The significance level was set at p 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with R Software Version 3.4.2. Mediation analyses were performed using the medflex package, which computes confidence intervals for TE, NDE and NIE estimates using the robust sandwich vari- ance estimator for linear regression . PNIE were cal- culated and confidence intervals were estimated by nonparametric bootstrap resampling. Missing values for variables included in the analytical model ranged from 0 to 25.2%; 189 participants 45% had complete data on all variables. We used multiple imputation by chained equations with 10 imputation sets using the mice package . Imputation was conducted for 424 participants not lost to follow-up at cycle 16. Im- putation models included all variables considered in the mediation models, as well as baseline self-report MVPA. Results The analytical sample comprised 424 participants 57% female, mean SD age at baseline = 10.2 0.6 years. Characteristics of participants retained for analysis and missing values for each variable of interest are presented in Table 1. No meaningful differences in sex p = .30 or age p = .19 were observed between participants retained n = 424 and not retained n = 513. Participants in- cluded were more likely to have household incomes at Doré et al.

We explored bivariate correlations and found that mental health was moderately correlated with each of perceived autonomy, competence and relatedness Pearson’s r ranged from .33 to .50, all p .05; perceived autonomy, competence and relatedness were moderately inter-correlated Pearson’s r ranged from .64 to .76, all p .05, suggesting that they capture distinct, but re- lated, concepts. Because the interactions between the exposure and each mediator were not statistically significant in linear regression analyses assessing TE results not shown, all interaction terms were dropped from the mediation ana- lysis . Table 2 presents NDE and NIE estimates for the mediated effects of each of autonomy, competence, relatedness and self-report MVPA assessed in separate models. We observed statistically significant estimates for NIE for all four variables. The NIEs suggest that a one-standard deviation increase in autonomy, compe- tence, relatedness and self-report MVPA was associated with an increase of 1.64 95%CI = 0.73, 2.55, 1.35 95%CI = 0.39, 2.31, 2.14 95%CI = 1.06, 3.22 and 1.77 95%CI = 0.75, 2.79 units in the mental health score, re- spectively, when number of years of PA is fixed.

The proportions mediated by self-report MVPA in the autonomy and competence models were approximately 27 and 31%, respectively. The pure natural indirect effect PNIE of self-report MVPA in the relatedness model was not statistically significant. In the 4-mediator model, relatedness mediated the largest propor- tion of the association, followed by autonomy and self- report MVPA with similar PNIE estimates Table 4. The proportion mediated should be interpreted cautiously when the NDE and NIE are in opposite directions, which explain why the NIE is larger than the TE; beta coefficient estimates might be more useful to compare the contribution of each mediator in these models. Discussion Previous research supports that PA leads to benefits in mental health and a reduced risk of mental disorders 46, Table 4 Beta coefficients and 95% Confidence Intervals CI for the natural direct, natural indirect and total effect of number of years in PA on mental health in joint mediation model including four mediators imputed data, n = 424 4-Mediator Modela ^β −0.22 95% CI NDE −2.73, 2.29 TE 2.92 1.06 −0.67 1.45 1.07 2.70 1.52, 4.31 0.25, 1.88 −1.43, 0.09 0.42, 2.48 0.10, 2.05 0.69, 4.70 aModel include four mediators Autonomy + Competence + Relatedness + MVPA NDE Natural Direct Effect, NIE Natural Indirect Effect, TE Total effect, PNIE Pure Natural Indirect Effect, CI Confidence Intervals Bold indicates statistically significant results p .05 53. However, our study is the first to investigate psycho- social factors and MVPA as mechanisms underpinning the positive effect of PA on mental health in adolescents. Identi- fication of the mediating role of autonomy, competence, re- latedness and MVPA provides a unique contribution to the literature by demonstrating that the positive effect of PA in childhood and early-to-mid adolescence on later mental health is attributable, at least in part, to these mechanisms. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effect of PA on mental health and mental disorders. Al- though we did not assess specifically biological mecha- nisms, the benefits of PA i.e., energy expenditure through movement , and especially MVPA, on mental health may relate to the secretion of serotonin and endor- phin , known respectively for their antidepressant and analgesic effects. PA also impact cortisol regulation , which reduces physiological reactivity to stress. However, these biological mechanisms may not be exhaustive in explaining the positive effect of PA participation on men- tal health. Alternative or additional mechanisms may be that PA participation enhances psychosocial determinants of mental health including self-esteem and develop- ment of a wide and supportive social network . The ex- perience of PA participation, also favors the satisfaction of feelings of autonomy, competence and relatedness specific to the PA context . Correspondingly, we found that more years of PA participation is associated with higher autonomy, and relatedness perceptions, which in turn positively impact mental health in late ado- lescence. In joint mediation models assessing the mediat- ing effect of each basic psychological need conjointly with self-report MVPA, the PNIE suggests that each of auton- omy, competence and relatedness explain a larger propor- tion of the association than MVPA in the 2-mediator models. The 4-mediator model reinforce those results. competence Most MATCH participants were exposed to social PA contexts; less than 10% from 2.8% in year 2 to 9.4% in year 4, see Additional file 1 engaged in individual sport Doré et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2020 17:9 only. Thus, the indirect effect of the PA and mental health association through perceived autonomy and competence could relate to the high quality of social in- teractions experienced by youth in PA. Ryan and Deci contend that satisfaction of psychological needs does not happen in isolation, but in high quality social experiences. These findings align with research suggest- ing that PA behavior i.e., cooperation, supporting each other’s success fosters feelings of autonomy and compe- tence 23, 24. The indirect effect through perceived re- latedness in our study is consistent with past work suggesting that PA in social contexts e.g. team sport can enhance perceived social acceptance , and may provide adolescents with opportunities to bond with their peers and feel connected, all of which can influence mental health positively . Our findings also align with the Positive Youth Development model which posits that when PA promotes positive psychological and social environments through supportive relation- ships or positive social norms, greater benefits on mental health are observed . Some studies suggest greater benefits for mental health from participation in team ac- tivities 46, 60, 61, although others 53, 62, 63 suggest no added value for team versus individual sport. Future studies should investigate the mediating effect of auton- omy, competence, relatedness and MVPA on the associ- ation between a PA variable comparing individual vs. group/team contexts and mental health. Strengths and limitations Strengths of this study include its longitudinal design in- cluding data collection every 4 months over 6 years from childhood into adolescence. We used measures of psycho- logical needs that have been validated in a sport context. Further, this study used a valid comprehensive measure of mental health that included emotional, psychological and social dimensions of well-being, and thus provided a glo- bal mental health assessment, that has been found to pre- dict the risk of common mental disorders . Limitations include that self-report PA measures are sub- ject to misclassification. Baseline mental health level in late childhood could confound the association of interest such that participants with better mental health may have been more likely to participate in PA, which could partially ex- plain the positive association between consistent PA partici- pation during the first 5 years of the study and mental health in year 6. In MATCH, mental health was measured for the first time in cycle 16, precluding adjustment for baseline mental health. MATCH was originally designed to describe PA and sport participation during childhood and adolescence. Thus, none of well-being, quality of life or mental health were assessed at baseline. Future studies should adjust for potential confounding by past mental study using Mendelian health. However, recent a randomization and accelerometer-assessed PA supports the hypothesis that PA protects against depression, but found no evidence that depression influences PA negatively . Residual confounding might have been an issue; future studies should consider adjusting for chronic physical ill- ness during childhood, living in urban vs. rural areas, family social environment and parents’ mental health. Previous studies suggest that PA and physical self-concept, a hier- archical construct comprising related subcomponents such as strength, body fat, endurance/fitness, sports competence, coordination, health, appearance and flexibility are re- ciprocally related and that physical self-concept medi- ates the association between PA and sport participation and depressive symptoms among girls in late adolescence . Future studies should consider investigating whether self-concept is a mediator of the association between PA and mental health. The mediation models were estimated without interaction between exposure and mediator or be- tween mediators in joint mediation models. In multivari- ate linear regression models, we tested interaction between the exposure and each mediator and the interaction be- tween mediators and none of the interactions were statisti- cally significant. This could represent a real absence of interaction or may be attributable to the small sample size which may render the analysis underpowered to detect interaction. Future studies using larger sample sizes should include statistically significant interactions, if any, in the mediation models. Selection bias due to loss-to-follow-up may have been an issue. Therefore, our results need replica- tion in other settings. Finally, use of a purposive sample may limit generalizability of the results. Conclusion This study suggests that level of autonomy, competence and relatedness experienced in PA contexts as well as MVPA explains the association between PA participation and mental, health at least in part. Our results support the development of strategies to encourage youth to engage and remain involved in PA contexts that enhance percep- tions of autonomy, competence and relatedness, in addition to strategies that promote increased MVPA, to promote mental health in adolescents.
