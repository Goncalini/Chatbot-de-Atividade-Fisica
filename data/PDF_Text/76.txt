Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 Open Access The impact of lifestyle Physical Activity Counselling in IN-PATients with major depressive disorders on physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, depression, and cardiovascular health risk markers: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial Markus Gerber1 , Johannes Beck2, Serge Brand1,3,4, Robyn Cody1, Lars Donath5, Anne Eckert3, Oliver Faude1, Xenia Fischer1, Martin Hatzinger6, Edith Holsboer-Trachsler3, Christian Imboden7, Undine Lang3, Sarah Mans7, Thorsten Mikoteit6, Anja Oswald2, Uwe Pühse1, Sofia Rey1, Ann-Katrin Schreiner2, Nina Schweinfurth3, Ursula Spitzer3 and Lukas Zahner1 Abstract Background: Major depressive disorder MDD is a widespread and burdensome psychiatric issue. Physical activity counselling may increase lifestyle physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness in this specific and particularly vulnerable population, which often suffers from both mental and physical health problems. Therefore, this study will examine the impact of a lifestyle physical activity counselling intervention on physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, depression, and cardiovascular health risk markers among in-patients diagnosed with MDD compared to controls. Secondary purposes are to examine the acceptability and perceived usefulness of the intervention among these patients, to find out whether the effectiveness of the intervention is moderated by genetic factors, and to compare baseline values with an age- and gender-matched group of healthy controls. Methods: The study is designed as a multi-centric two-arm randomized clinical trial including an intervention group and a placebo control group, allocation concealment, single-blinding, and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants N = 334 will be continuously recruited from four clinics specialized in the treatment of MDD. The intervention builds on a standardized, theory-based, low-cost lifestyle physical activity counselling programme, which was specifically designed for an in-patient rehabilitation setting. The placebo control condition consists of general instructions about health-enhancing physical activity. Data assessments will take place 2–3 weeks after admission to in-patient treatment baseline, and 6 weeks post and 12 months follow-up after discharge from in-patient treatment. The primary outcome is objectively assessed physical activity at follow-up.

Trials 2019 20:367 Continued from previous page Discussion: Because regular physical activity has proven to be an important predictor of long-term response and remission in patients with major depression, we believe that our planned study may lay important groundwork by showing how individually tailored lifestyle physical activity counselling can be integrated into given clinical structures. Improving physical activity may have important implications for tackling metabolic and cardiovascular disease and increasing mood and cognitive functioning in this at-risk population, hence limiting the future burden of multiple chronic conditions. Increased physical activity may also reduce the likelihood of future depressive episodes. By moving towards the primary prevention of chronic physical conditions, much can be done to enhance the quality and quantity of life of people with MDD. Trial registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN10469580.

Keywords: Acceptability, Biomarkers, Cardiorespiratory fitness, Cardiovascular risk markers, Counselling, Depression, Exercise, In-patients, Physical activity, Psychiatry, Serotonin transporter polymorphic promoter region Background Major depressive disorder MDD is a psychiatric issue characterized by the loss of interests and pleasure in activ- ities that were otherwise interesting and pleasant for the individual. Further, individuals with MDD report impaired sleep, suicidal behaviour, cognitive impairments, social withdrawal, diffuse and complex pain syndromes and is- sues, along with loss of sexual interests. As shown by the World Health Organization , MDD is widespread and its course is often chronic. Estimates of lifetime prevalence for MDD range between 10 and 20%, and the 1-year prevalence varies between 5 and 10%, affecting people of all ages, genders, and socio-economic status 2, 3. De- pression is often recurrent, and the risk of relapse is also high. Significant associations have been reported between MDD, morbidity, disability, mortality, and suffering for patients and their families . The WHO Global Burden of Disease study suggests that mild to moderate depressive disorder is associated with the second greatest number of life years lost due to premature death or disability DALY and will most likely be the leading cause in 2030 . Moreover, MDD is the leading cause of years of life lived with disability YLD in men and women . Close links have been found between MDD and poor quality of life, high medical expenditure, and increased use of healthcare services . Moreover, a high comor- bidity with other chronic medical conditions has been found in patients with MDD, all of which put a consider- able burden on the healthcare system. For instance, people with depression are more than twice as likely to develop metabolic conditions e.g. diabetes and meta- bolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases 9–13. MDD is also linked with impaired cognitive functioning, leading to declines in information processing and re- duced memory functioning . As a possible moderator for both disease vulnerability and treatment response on the one hand, and occurrence of somatic comorbidities on the other, a dysfunction of serotonergic homeostasis has been proposed to play a crucial role 15–17. Moreover, a polymorphic region in the promotor of the serotonin transporter 5-HTT gene 5-HTTLPR, which is characterized by two alleles, a long l and a short s allele , has been suggested to be as- sociated with the incidence of depression after exposure to stressful life events . However, this association re- mains inconclusive, since some studies failed to replicate these findings 19, 20. The inconsistencies might be due to unidentified environmental In this regard, Rethorst et al. recently found a significant interaction between the 5-HTTLPR genotype, physical activity, and depressive symptoms. Individuals with at least one s allele had significant higher levels of depressive symptoms at low-level physical activity compared to individuals with the ll genotype. factors. Further, people with both MDD and subthreshold de- pressive symptoms have an increased risk of premature mortality compared to the general population 22, 23. There is a life expectancy gap of 10–15 years between psychiatric patients including MDD and people with- out psychiatric diagnosis. Importantly, around 80% of all preventable deaths are due to physical conditions, whereas suicide is only responsible for 14% . Al- though these disparities have been recognized since the mid-1980s, this life expectancy gap has widened during the last 30 years . Lawrence et al. therefore con- cluded that “public efforts should be directed towards improving physical health to reduce mortality in people with mental illness, in addition to on-going efforts to prevent suicide” p. 1. Standard treatment, remission rates, and complementary treatment options Treatment options for MDD consist of pharmacological including and non-pharmacological psychotherapy, neuromodulation , physical activity , and nutritional such as adjuvant omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids , or the combin- ation of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions , supplements Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 treatments 30–32. However, the effectiveness of standard pharmacological treatment is limited , and the use of antidepressant medication is associated with side effects and poor adherence . It has been estimated that only about 30–50% of all patients show a response to a first antidepressant trial with single-action or dual-action antidepressant monotherapy 36, 37. Remission is found in an even smaller portion of participants 15–40% 37, 38. In other words, more than 50% of all patients do not respond after first-line treatment. Current clinical practice employs switch, combination, and/or augmentation strat- egies after failure of first-line treatment. These augmenta- tions include co-administration of antidepressants with alternative pharmacology, atypical neuroleptics, or mood stabilizers . However, even these additional treatments often do not result in remission . In light of the massive burden associated with MDD, the low rate of full recovery is problematic . Re- searchers have therefore claimed that a greater variety of cost-effective, accessible, and alternative/complementary treatments are needed 40, 41. A further justification for this claim comes from the studies which found rela- tively low compliance with antidepressant medication, indicating that 20–60% of primary care patients stop taking their medication within the first 3 weeks after drug prescription . One important reason is that the use of psycho-pharmaceuticals may have negative side effects, such as clinically significant weight gain and, above all, SSRI-related sexual dysfunction 43, 44. Spe- cifically, weight gain is of particular relevance, as it is as- sociated with reduced quality of life, social stigma, greater morbidity e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, and mortality . As a consequence, non-pharmacological and comple- mentary strategies have been envisaged to improve the prognosis of MDD , including exercise therapy . The use of alternative and complementary treatments is popular and widespread in western societies. For in- stance, in a US-based sample of severely depressed par- ticipants, more than half indicated having used such options during the past year , most likely because these alternatives are consistent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations towards health and life . Part of such orientation is physical activity, and therefore, according to Dunn et al. , exercise seems a viable treatment option because it “can be rec- ommended for most individuals, and does not carry a negative social stigma” p. 1. Exercise as an alternative or complementary therapy in the treatment of MDD In several countries, health foundations have encouraged general practitioners to prescribe exercise as a front-line strategy in the treatment of MDD 40, 49, 50. Research also shows that regular exercise and physical activity have the potential to reduce the risk of developing de- pression 51, 52. Meanwhile, several meta-analyses have examined the effects of exercise on depressive symptoms in randomized controlled trials RCTs among adult populations. The first meta-analysis was published in their findings showed that exercise treatment was associ- ated with an effect size of d = − 1.10, pointing towards a significant reduction in depressive symptoms compared to no treatment. However, a higher effect size was found in studies with shorter follow-up periods. Using a more extensive search procedure, Rethorst et al. identified highlighting that exercise treatment results in signifi- cantly to controls. decreased depression scores compared In a recent Cochrane review, Cooney et al. found similar effects d = − 0.62 when comparing exercise to standard treatment, no treatment, or placebo control. However, after excluding trials which did not fulfil the ad- equate quality standards such as allocation concealment, blinded outcome assessment, intention-to-treat analysis, d = − 0.18. the effect size was no longer significant Nevertheless, those eight studies which presented long- term follow-up data resulted in a moderate effect d = − 0.33 in favour of exercise treatment. Moreover, Schuch et al. pointed out that publication bias may lead to an underestimation of the standardized mean difference re- ported in RCTs, and that programmes are particularly effective if they promote moderate intensity physical activ- ity, if they have an emphasis on aerobic exercise activities, and if the interventions are provided and supervised by exercise professionals. Kvam et al. summarized in their meta-analysis that physical activity interventions showed large effects sizes when compared to no interven- tions g = 1.24, and moderate effect sizes when compared to control conditions g = 0.68 and to usual care g = 0.48 . However, when compared to psychological interventions g = 0.22 or antidepressant medication g = 0.08, effect sizes were small. However, again when combined with antidepressant medication, effect sizes were moderate g = 0.50. Further, and most importantly, Kvam et al. showed that the effect of physical activity had a moderate to large significant effect on depression compared to con- trol conditions g = − 0.68, but that the effect was small and not significant at follow-up g = − 0.22. The latter re- sult clearly indicates the need for and necessity to build up a well-designed intervention to thoroughly monitor the transition from guided and supervised interventions during stays in hospital and the patients’ conditions and settings after discharge, when they should monitor the physical activity themselves. Evidence also supports that individual tailoring is recommendable, as both aerobic Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 and anaerobic exercise activities have a similar potential to reduce depression 56, 57 and to foster exercise motiv- ation . Blumenthal et al. 4, 31 compared whether 4-month aerobic exercise programmes are more effective than pharmacotherapy in two separate studies with 156 older patients and 202 adults with MDD. Taken together, that exercise and antidepressant these studies reveal medication lead to similar reductions in depressive symptoms, and that both treatments are associated with higher remission rates compared to a placebo control condition . Beyond these short-term outcomes, Hoff- man et al. examined the long-term effects of the dif- ferent treatments. While neither group assignment exercise vs pharmacotherapy nor antidepressant medi- cation usage during the follow-up period were related to response or remission at 12-month follow-up, regular exercise during the follow-up period proved to be the only significant predictor. In other words, patients who regularly engaged in exercise activities after the initial treatment were less likely to have MDD at follow-up. These results corroborate previous research with older adults, showing that regular post-treatment exercise leads to a considerably lower relapse rate 6 months after the end of the treatment . While these results suggest that exercise therapy can be equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms as antidepressants in the short run and that prolonged regular exercise might prevent relapses after the end of treatment, it is evident that the positive effects of exer- cise therapy may dissipate if the intervention is discon- tinued and if patients are not able to maintain a physically active lifestyle. Effects of exercise training on cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular health A physically active lifestyle is associated with increased cardiorespiratory fitness CRF, and high levels of CRF are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mor- bidity and other chronic conditions such as obesity, dia- betes, cognitive decline, or specific forms of cancer . Moreover, high CRF is associated with reduced risks of premature mortality, even after controlling for the influ- ence of hereditary factors 62, 63. Nevertheless, several studies show that people with de- pression have lower physical activity 64, 65 and CRF levels 66, 67. Thus, it has been hypothesized that low physical activity and CRF constitute a possible link be- tween depression and comorbid somatic disorders 68, 69. Importantly, a meta-analytic study revealed that ex- ercise interventions significantly contribute to increased CRF in patients with MDD . Based on seven RCTs, an overall effect size of 0.64 was found, which corre- sponds to a mean increase of 3.05 ml/kg/min of oxygen uptake. As shown in population studies, improvements of 3.5 ml/kg/min in VO2max are associated with a 13 and 15% decrease in cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality . Summary of main findings and special challenges in patients with major depressive disorder Strong empirical evidence exists showing that exercise plays a beneficial role in the treatment of MDD. Exercise, antidepressants, and psychotherapy have comparable ef- fects among patients with MDD , although, above all, the combination of both physical activity and standard medication treatment appears to be particularly promising . Further, exercise might even be successful in redu- cing treatment-resistant depression . Given these ob- servations, it seems recommendable to use exercise more systematically as an add-on to standard care during in- patient 50, 55, 72. Moreover, promoting lifestyle physical activity seems to have the potential to prevent relapses after the end of hospitalization 59, 73. treatment low mood, Initiating and maintaining regular exercise among pa- tients with MDD is a major challenge, especially because depressive symptoms interfere with their capacity to self-regulate health-related behaviours 33, 68. MDD is including recurrent depressive episodes, often cyclical, which might lead to an interruption of exercise regimes. Moreover, depression can be linked with motivational and volitional deficits in all areas of daily life due to hopelessness, pessimism, loss of interest and enjoyment in ordinary things, persistent low self- efficacy, limited capacity to plan due to impaired execu- tive function, and a tendency to postpone tasks 33, 68. In line with this, studies show that depression is associ- ated with limited exercise self-efficacy, stronger negative outcome expectations, reduced intentions to exercise, poor maintenance self-efficacy, and increased perception of situational barriers 68, 74. At the same time, higher body mass index BMI, and the presence of somatic co- morbidities are particularly important barriers for people with depression to engage in regular physical activity . In other words, engagement with and adherence to recommended physical activity levels remain a major challenge. Providing MDD patients with professional support to identify and achieve their physical activity and exercise goals may enable them to overcome psy- chological barriers, and maintain motivation towards regular physical activity. Thus, Gerber et al. 76, 77 sug- gested that looking into lifestyle physical activity coun- selling should become a top priority to improve patients’ behavioural skills such as action planning, coping with exercise-related barriers, and social support. Such behav- ioural skills are key to maintaining a more physically active lifestyle and to achieve long-term positive out- comes in mental health. Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 Physical activity counselling and behavioural skill training to foster regular exercise participation Several theories have been developed to facilitate change in health behaviour . Two recent models are the Health Action Process Approach model and the Motivation and Volition-process model . The common ground of these models is that they focus on both motivational how people form an intention and post-intentional volitional processes, including action planning, identification of per- sonal and environmental barriers, coping planning, and re- lapse management. Both models have resulted in theory- based intervention programmes that provide support for long-term behaviour change in overweight people and patients suffering from somatic conditions 81–84. As an example, Fuchs et al. showed that amongst 220 in- active in-patients of an orthopaedic rehabilitation clinic, motivational and volitional counselling resulted in a moderate-to-large short-term increase d = 0.72 in physical activity in the intervention group compared to the control group. Although the group difference diminished until 12- month follow-up, the intervention group still reported in- creased physical activity levels. Nevertheless, while these findings are promising, research about the potential of such programmes in patients with MDD is scarce. A recent study showed that lifestyle counselling in- cluding diet, exercise, sunlight exposure, and sleep can be an effective add-on to antidepressant treatment. While remission reached 60% in the combined treat- ment group, this rate was considerably lower in the con- trol group 10% . So far, only one RCT exists in which the effects of individually tailored physical activity counselling through professionally trained physical activ- ity facilitators have been tested in patients with MDD 86–88. While the findings showed that the intervention group had significantly increased physical activity levels at follow-up, this study was carried out in an out-patient setting, did not focus on patients with low physical activ- ity levels, and did not assess physical activity objectively. Purpose of the study Given this background, the main purpose of this study is to implement and evaluate a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of an individually tailored lifestyle physical activity counselling intervention on objectively assessed physical activity among in-patients diagnosed with MDD compared to placebo controls. Patients will receive exercise prescriptions tailored to- wards their current physical activity level, activity type, and intensity preferences in order to change their exer- cise and physical activity habits beyond their stay at the clinic. To ensure a high adherence among patients assigned to the intervention group across the entire study period, new technologies such as an app-based activity coaching platform and physical remote counselling telephone coaching and message prompts will be used . Secondary purposes are as follows: a b c d to examine how the intervention impacts on the secondary outcomes self-reported physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, autonomic function, cognitive and social determinants of exercise, depression severity, self-perceived physical and psy- chological health, insomnia symptoms, cognitive function, cardiovascular risk profile, and biomarkers of MDD; to find out whether the serotonin transporter 5-HTT polymorphic promoter region 5-HTTLPR as a genetic factor moderates the effects of the intervention; to gain insights into the acceptability and perceived usefulness of the intervention among patients; and to compare baseline values with an age- and gender-matched group of healthy controls. Methods/design Study design The study is designed as a multi-centric, two-arm RCT in- cluding an intervention group IG and a placebo control group PCG, allocation concealment, single-blinding, and intention-to-treat analysis. The study is a cooperation be- tween four Swiss psychiatric clinics two public, two pri- vate and the Department of Sport, Exercise and Health of the University of Basel. Figure 1 provides an overview of the planned study design. The 25-item CONSORT check- list was used when designing the study. Figure 2 repre- sents the SPIRIT figure, providing an overview of foreseen time points, interventions, and assessments. The descrip- tion of the study protocol contains all elements listed in the SPIRIT checklist see Additional file 1. Patients will be assigned randomly stratified by age, gender, and clinic to an extended personalized physical activity and exercise counselling programme IG or to general instructions about health-enhancing physical ac- tivity PCG. To ensure allocation concealment, alloca- tion to groups will be done by a computer-generated code after the baseline assessment has taken place. A re- searcher OF will generate an allocation sequence and assign participants to either the intervention or placebo control group. Further researchers engaged in field work RC and SR will recruit and enrol participants. Clini- cians, researchers, and physical activity facilitators will not be blinded to treatment allocation because of the na- ture of the study. To minimize subjective bias, patients do not know whether they have been allocated to the intervention or placebo control group. Before providing informed con- sent, patients will be informed that the goal of the study Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 Fig. 1 Overview of the planned randomized controlled trial study design.

Out- comes will be assessed by researchers who do not know whether a patient belongs to the IG or the PCG. Participants Recruitment and power calculations Clinical in-patients aged 18–65 years with a current diagno- sis of major depression ICD-10 will be continuously re- cruited from the Psychiatric Services Solothurn, Psychiatric Clinics of the University of Basel, Psychiatric Clinic Wyss, Münchenbuchsee, and the Psychiatric Clinic Sonnenhalde, Riehen. In previous studies with non-depressed individuals, individually tailored physical activity promotion was associ- ated with a moderate effect d = 0.50 on the primary out- come physical activity 80, 81. So far, only one study exists examining physical activity counselling among out- patients with depression, yielding an adjusted odds ratios of up corresponding d = 0.45. Conversely, a relatively small effect size d = 0.28 was observed in a Cochrane review of intervention studies promoting physical activity among generally healthy people . Similarly, remote interven- tions such as telephone-based, app-based, and Internet- based coaching versus a control group were associated with rather small effect sizes for change in physical activity d = 0.20 . Given these observations, we assume a small-to- intervention on the primary moderate effect of our outcome d = 0.30. Accordingly, the optimal sample size to detect a significant effect at follow-up is 278 participants two independent groups, one-tailed, α-error probability = 0.05, power = 0.80. With 20% expected dropouts from baseline to follow-up , the targeted sample size is N = 334 IG, n = 167: PCG, n = 167. This means that every centre will recruit approximately 40 participants per year n = 20 in the IG, n = 20 in the PCG. Dependent on the size of the clinics, this corresponds to a recruitment rate of 20–25% of the patients. Enrolment will be systematically monitored by the sponsor-investigator in order to recruit a sufficient number of participants within the planned timeframe. Screening A structured clinical interview will be conducted by a psychiatrist to ensure that all participants fulfil the ICD-10 diagnosis for a single episode F32, recurrent MDD F33, or bipolar disorder type II F31-II. The screening also in- cludes assessment of the duration of the current depres- sive episode, the number of previous depressive episodes, psychiatric and somatic comorbidities, and family history of psychiatric and somatic conditions. To assess symptom severity, a trained staff member will apply the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale HAMD17 as part of a clinical interview , while patients’ self-ratings are based on the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory BDI 97, 98, along with the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire IPAQ to assess self- Gerber et al.

Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 Healthy controls To compare baseline differences in the primary and sec- ondary outcomes between patients and healthy con- trols, an age- and gender-matched sample of 167 participants will be recruited through advertisements in newspapers and through word-of-mouth recommenda- tion. Inclusion criteria for healthy controls are: women and men; 18–65 years of age; HAMD17 ≤ 7; BDI ≤ 13; currently not meeting the ACSM physical activity rec- ommendations IPAQ 150 min/week of moderate-to- vigorous physical activity; written informed consent; and ability to speak and read German. Procedures Data assessment Screening will take place in the first week after admis- sion to in-patient treatment. Identical data assessment will take place 2–3 weeks after admission to in-patient treatment baseline, and 6 weeks post and 12 months follow-up after discharge from in-patient treatment. The primary outcome is objectively assessed physical ac- tivity Actigraph wGT3x-BT monitor, 7 days. Secondary outcomes are self-reported physical activity, cardiorespi- ratory fitness, autonomic function cognitive and social self- determinants of exercise, depression severity, perceived physical and psychological health, insomnia symptoms, cognitive function, cardiovascular health risk markers, and biomarkers of MDD. Moreover, the sero- tonin transporter 5-HTT polymorphic promoter region 5-HTTLPR is assessed as a potential moderator of intervention effects . More information regarding the various instruments is presented in the following. Intervention and placebo control condition Patients assigned to the IG or the PCG receive treatment as usual from their psychiatrists according to the Swiss treatment guidelines for major depression . More- over, patients from both groups continue the therapy provided by their practitioner and therapist for their de- pression i.e. psychotherapy, use of antidepressants. Intervention programme: individually tailored physical activity promotion Patients assigned to the IG will receive an individually tailored physical activity counselling to provide support and encouragement to increase physical activity. Two face-to-face meetings will take place during the clinical treatment which lasts between 6 and 8 weeks on aver- age. The meetings will take place approximately in weeks 4 and 6 of in-patient treatment. The same phys- ical activity facilitator will develop a physical activity plan with the participant, tailored to the individual’s current activity levels, activity type, and intensity prefer- ences, and will promote behavioural change techniques which have been proven effective in previous studies 102–107. Additionally, starting 1 week after discharge from in-patient treatment, patients of the IG will receive bi-weekly telephone counselling and SMS prompts until push notifications will help to ensure adherence of pa- tients to their physical activity and exercise plans/pre- scription, or facilitate the adaptation of these plans. Furthermore, a smartphone app will be developed which can be used to support patients in their planning and self-monitoring exercise behaviour. physical activity and of Exercise prescriptions follow the standards of the American College of Sports Medicine 90, 91, stating that individuals should engage in at least 30 min of moderate-intensity physical activity on 5 days per week, or 20 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise on 3 days each week. A variety of activities such as aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, multi-modal group-based exercise, daily physical activity e.g. walk or take bike for grocery shopping, and so forth, will be advised. The intervention builds on a standardized, theory- based, short, low-cost lifestyle physical activity counsel- ling programme, which was specifically designed for an rehabilitation setting MoVo-Lisa = Motiv- in-patient ation, Volition and Lifestyle-integrated Sport Activity. It consists of two individual face-to-face counselling ses- sions and an extended counselling session via telephone after discharge from the clinic. The first session 60–75 min will take place 1 week after the baseline data assess- ment. The second session 45–60 min will take place 1 week before the end of in-patient treatment. The third session 75–90 min will take place 1–2 weeks after dis- charge from in-patient treatment via telephone to give patients the possibility to test their physical activity plans in their familiar environment, and to allow the identifi- cation of real-life physical activity obstacles. All sessions aim at promoting motivational and vol- itional strategies to foster long-term behavioural change. Following Michie et al.’s behaviour change tax- onomy, motivational strategies include: clarification of personal health objectives goal setting outcome, V1: 1.3; contemplation of different actions to achieve the health objectives goal setting behaviour, V1: 1.1; re- flection of pros and cons associated with the new behav- iour pros and cons, V1: 9.2; checking self-concordance of these goals review behaviour/outcome goals, V1: 1.5/ 1.7; and reflection of outcome experiences monitoring of emotional consequences, V1: 5.4. Volitional strategies include: generation of implementation intentions action planning, V1:1.4; anticipating personal barriers prob- lem-solving, V1:1.2; developing counter strategies re- structuring of the physical/social environment, V1:12.1/ contract, V1:1.8; behavioural 12.2; contracting Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 mobilization of social support social support, V1:3; and self-monitoring the new behaviour self-monitoring of the behaviour and outcomes of the behaviour, V1:2.3/2.4 . The intervention will be designed to match the specific stage of depression. Facilitators will focus on pessimistic beliefs such as negative outcome expectations and self- efficacy, as well as planning deficits linked with depres- sion . Recently, reviewers identified losing weight 83% of patients, improving mood 81%, and reducing stress 78% as the most relevant motives for exercise in patients with severe mental illnesses, whereas low mood and stress 61% and lack of social support 50% turned out to be the most relevant exercise barriers . Phys- ical activity facilitators will place a special emphasis on these motives and barriers when developing physical ac- tivity promotion strategies. Administration of experimental intervention The aim is to have at least two face-to-face individual counselling sessions, have 26 follow-up telephone con- tacts on a bi-weekly basis, and send 52 message prompts by the 12-month time point. Telephone con- tacts will be used to discuss problem-solving around bar- riers, reinforce progress towards behaviour change, and adapt initial goals and plans. Moreover, follow-up con- tacts serve to strengthen relapse strategies so that pa- tients understand that relapses are common during behaviour change, and that dysfunctional cognitions, emotion, and behaviours can jeopardize maintenance of a physically active lifestyle . Smartphone application A smartphone app will support patients in their plan- ning and self-monitoring of physical activity and exer- cise behaviour. This newly developed app designed for online coaching will serve as a tool for communi- cation, exchange of weekly activity plans, and docu- mentation of physical activity. Via the physical activity facilitator can assist the participant in developing physical activity plans and can access the self-monitoring data. Both participants and physical activity facilitators can access and modify the physical activity plans online. the app, Adherence to the intervention protocol will be moni- tored by the physical activity facilitators. A thorough documentation of the physical activity facilitator’s work with the participant will ensure that the adherence to the protocol will be visible. Bi-weekly meetings with the physical activity facilitators and the study team will allow for continued training and minimize differences in the delivery of the intervention between facilitators and within facilitators over time. “Core document activity based on the Placebo control condition One week after the baseline assessment, in addition to treatment as usual, patients assigned to the PCG will re- ceive written information about health-enhancing phys- ical for Switzerland” published by the Federal Office of Sport BASPO in collaboration with other institutions. This document summarizes the current knowledge in relation to health-enhancing physical activity. The patients will obtain information about the following topics: why is physical activity healthy; what are the minimal physical activity recommendations; how physically active are people in Switzerland; and what are the costs of physical inactivity? One week before the end of the in-patient treatment, patients will meet the physical activity facilitator. The fa- cilitator will summarize the key contents of the “core document” by showing a short animation film https:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNZenOnGI0U and discuss questions with the patient. The control condition is not intended as a bona fide intervention 109, 110 and an active therapy, but to control for placebo effects of the intervention condition. Selection, education, and training of the physical activity facilitator Physical activity counselling will be done by personnel with a background in exercise science and/or psych- ology, because a majority of patients want professional support when trying to engage in more physical activity . Physical activity facilitators will be trained in behav- ioural change techniques and coaching through the su- pervisors. The facilitators will be regularly supervised by the investigators. Knowledge and coaching style of each facilitator will be tested prior to the first coaching session. Participation in physical activity and exercise programmes during in-patient treatment The physical activity facilitator will inform all partici- pants about the existing exercise activities offered at the clinic. Both groups IG and PCG have the possibility to voluntarily participate in these activities. Ethical considerations The proposed research will be carried out in accordance with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki 1964. Central ethical approval has been confirmed from the “Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz” ref. approval no. 2018-00976. More- local ethical approval has been obtained for all over, study sites. Thus, local ethical approval has been ob- tained from the “Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz” for the clinics located in Basel, Riehen, Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 and Solothurn, and from the “Ethikkommission Bern” for the clinic located in Münchenbuchsee. The interven- tion study was registered in the WHO trial register trial number ISRCTN10469580. All participants will be in- formed about the general goals of the study. Informed written consent is required before study entry. Partici- pants are informed that participation in the study is vol- untary and that they can withdraw or discontinue at any time without further obligation or potential disadvan- tages. The participants and outcome assessors are blinded. Medication intake will be recorded as a part intervention, and follow-up of assessments. the baseline, post After completion of the data assessment, all personal data of the patients will be encoded each patient will re- ceive a project ID number, so that it will no longer be possible to identify the patients. Data will be entered into an SPSS file. The collected data will be saved digit- ally. Backup files will be stored regularly on the external cloud Switchdrive@Universität Basel. The coding list will be stored in a safe place. Data will only be used for scientific purposes, and will be discarded after comple- tion of the laboratory analyses. Paper records of the study will only be accessible to the main investigators, and will be kept in locked cupboards. After 10 years, all records will be destroyed. Measures The primary outcome, secondary outcomes, modera- tors, and covariates will be assessed identically at baseline, post intervention, and follow-up by the same examiner at the clinic. As an incentive, healthy con- trols will receive 50 CHF for their participation in the study. Patients will receive 20 CHF if they participate in the post-intervention and follow-up assessments as a compensation for their travel expenses. After each data assessment, healthy controls and patients will receive a health profile with information regard- ing their physical activity and fitness level, blood pressure, blood glucose, blood lipid profile, and body composition. Participants will be instructed to abstain from food and liquids including coffee and tea from 22:00 the night before the evaluation for the accurate measurement of blood glucose, blood lipids, and autonomic function. Assessments will last approxi- mately 2 h. The following procedures will be applied by well-trained staff adhering to standardized, quality- controlled protocols. Primary outcome Objective physical activity Objective physical activity will be assessed with an accel- erometer wGT3x-BT; Actigraph, Shalimar, FL, USA worn around the hip. The devices will be worn during daytime for 7 consecutive days to assess a full weekly period. The sampling epoch will be set at 10 s . Time per day spent in moderate physical activity MPA; 1952–5723 counts per minute, 3 MET and vigorous physical activity VPA; 5274 counts per minute, 6 MET is determined based on the raw accelerometer counts and the ActiLife® computer software, with cut-off values derived from Freedson et al. . Participants will fill in a non-wear time sheet e.g. to assess physical activities during which it was not possible to wear the monitor, such as swimming. Physical activities listed on the non-wear time sheet will be included as moderate- to-vigorous physical activities, based on the intensity levels defined in the Physical Activity Compendium 113, 114. To be included in the data analyses, partici- pants will need at least 5 valid days, including ≥4 valid weekdays and ≥ 1 valid weekend day . Following Herrmann et al. , only days with at least 10 h of wear time are considered a valid measure of daily phys- ical activity. The validity of the Actigraph accelerometer device has been documented previously . To the best of our knowledge, no minimal clinically important change MCID scores are currently available for phys- ical activity in patients with MDD. The ACSM recom- mends that individuals should accumulate at least 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week . This is in line with a study by Hoffman et al. showing that in patients with MDD there is a linear in- crease associated with self-reported exercise regarding the probability of at least partial remission until 150 min of exercise per week, whereas the response curve flattens off beyond this threshold. see www.simpaq.org. Data Secondary outcomes Self-reported physical activity Self-reported physical activity will be assessed with a newly developed questionnaire Simple Physical Activ- ity Questionnaire SIMPAQ specifically developed for the use with psychiatric patients . Validation of this instrument with psychiatric patients is cur- for rently underway healthy people show that the instrument is reasonably associated with objectively assessed physical activity . The SIMPAQ uses an interview format 5–10 min in duration to assess time in bed, structured ex- ercise participation, and incidental or non-structured physical research group assessed in university students show that moderate- to-vigorous physical activity estimated with the SIM- PAQ correlates moderately to highly with accelerom- eter data r = 0.30–0.70 . The same public health recommendations apply as for objectively mea- sured physical activity . activity. Data from our Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 Cardiorespiratory fitness The Åstrand and Rodahl indirect test of maximal oxygen uptake VO2max will be used to assess cardiorespira- tory fitness . The test will be performed on a bi- cycle ergometer Bike Forma; Technogym at the same time of the day starting between 08:00 and 10:00. This test has been validated for the purposes of measuring submaximal fitness . The pedalling frequency dur- ing the Åstrand test will be set at 50 rpm, and the work- load adjusted so that the heart rate is kept between 130 and 160 beats per minute bpm in participants younger than 40 years old and between 120 and 150 bpm in par- ticipants older than 40 years old. To ensure that partici- pants maintain their exercise intensity level at 13 or 14 slightly strenuous, we will employ the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale . When the heart rate re- mains stable after 5 or 6 min, a steady state is reached. Peak oxygen uptake l/min will be estimated based on mean steady state, sex, and power output, using a nomo- gram , and including a correction factor for age. After correction of body weight, oxygen uptake will be expressed as peak VO2max ml/kg/min. Gender and age-adjusted cut-off values will be used to categorize participants into groups with low, moderate, and high CRF . The reliability and validity of the Åstrand nomogram and deriving VO2max has been documented in a previous study . extrapolation for linear Autonomic function Using heart rate monitors V800; Polar Electro, Finland, following a 5-min period of rest, R–R intervals will be recorded over 5 min; based on their variation, the heart rate variability HRV is calculated. This non-invasive method allows for the accurate evaluation of autonomic nervous system activity . Recorded R–R intervals will be processed and analysed with Kubios HRV . Evidence for the validity of the Polar V800 monitor for the assessment of HRV at rest has been documented in a prior study . In the time domain, the standard devi- ation of normal-to-normal intervals SDNN and the root mean square of standard deviation RMSSD will be examined. Additionally, low-frequency power LF nu; bandwidth 0.04–0.15 Hz and high-frequency power HF nu; bandwidth 0.15–0.4 Hz, expressed as normalized units, as well as the LF nu/HF nu ratio will be examined as frequency-based HRV parameters. To the best of our knowledge, no MCID scores are currently available for HRV . Perceived fitness A one-item proxy measure is used to assess subjectively perceived physical fitness . The following item will be used: “Overall, how would you rate your physical fitness?” Answering options range from 1 very poor fit- ness to 10 excellent fitness. The validity of this item as an indicator of perceived fitness has been established previously. High correlations were found with the 12- item Perceived Physical Fitness scale . Moreover, this measure proved to be reasonably associated with objective physical fitness, perceived well-being, and sleep 128, 129. No MCID scores exist for this measure. Exercise-related self-efficacy Three items referring to beginning, maintaining, and restarting exercise after a relapse are used to assess exercise-related self-efficacy beliefs e.g. “I feel confident to start with a new exercise activity” . This scale proved to be a psychometrically sound measure in a pre- vious study and has been used in previous inter- vention studies 80–82, 131. The scale ranges from 0 not at all confident to 5 100% confident in myself . The three items are added to obtain a single score. No MCID scores exist for this measure. Exercise-related outcome expectancies Nine positive ‘pros’; e.g. “I can improve my physical ap- pearance if I regularly exercise” and seven negative for- mulated items ‘cons’; e.g. “If I exercise, I end up in situations where I feel embarrassed” are used to assess outcome expectancies . The items are anchored on a 4-point Likert-type scale from 1 not true to 4 com- pletely true. Satisfactory psychometric properties of these items have been demonstrated . Items are combined into two composite scores positive and nega- tive by the arithmetic mean of each. No MCID scores exist for this measure. Exercise intention One item is used to assess exercise-related goal inten- tions . More specifically, participants are asked about the strength of their intention to exercise regularly during the next few weeks and months 0 = no intention to 5 = very strong intention. This measure proved to have acceptable reliability and validity in previous stud- ies 133, 134. No MCID scores exist for this measure. Exercise-related self-concordance Exercise-related self-concordance is assessed with the 12-item SSK scale , which is consistent with the self-concordance model by Sheldon and Elliot . The SSK scale consists of four subscales that assess the in- trinsic e.g. “I would exercise because it’s just fun for me”, identified e.g. “I would exercise because I have good reasons to be physically active”, introjected e.g. “I would exercise because otherwise I would have a guilty conscience” and extrinsic e.g. “I would exercise be- cause others tell me to become physically active” Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 reasons for exercising. All items are answered on a 6- point Likert scale from 1 not at all true to 6 com- pletely true. An overall index is built by summing the identified and intrinsic mean scores and subtracting the introjected and extrinsic mean scores. The reliability and validity of this instrument have been established previ- ously . No MCID scores exist for this measure. Action planning Five items with established reliability and validity are ad- information about participants’ ministered to collect level of action planning 134, 136. These items assess the degree to which individuals have pre-planned their exercise participation. Thus, participants are asked whether they normally make plans when, where, how, how often, and with whom they exercise. Answers range from 1 not at all true to 4 completely true. The item scores are summed to obtain an overall index. No MCID scores exist for this measure. Perceived exercise barriers A 19-item scale that lists various obstacles to regular exer- cise participation is used to measure perceived exercise barriers . Satisfactory psychometric properties of this instrument were reported previously 68, 137, 138. Partic- ipants indicate on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 almost never to 4 almost always how often they perceive these barriers e.g. “I have too much work to do”. The mean is computed to obtain a single score. No MCID scores exist for this measure. Coping planning A 5-item index is used to gain insight into coping plan- ning . Participants are asked to what degree they use self-regulation strategies to overcome potential exer- cise barriers e.g. “I have made a detailed plan regarding what to do in difficult situations in order to act in ac- cording to my intentions”. Answers range from 1 not at all true to 4 completely true. The item scores are summed up to obtain a composite index. The reliability and validity of this scale have been established previously 134, 136. No MCID scores exist for this measure. Exercise-related social support A seven-item index is used to assess social support from relevant others e.g. “Close family or friends help me plan my exercise” . Answers are given on a 4-point Likert scale with values from 1 almost never to 4 al- most always. This scale proved to be a psychometrically sound measure in previous studies 131, 132. No MCID scores exist for this measure. Depression severity The HAMD17 total score and the Beck Depression Inventory BDI 97, 98 are used to assess depression severity. The BDI is a 21-item tool frequently used to as- sess symptoms of unipolar depression such as affective, behavioural, cognitive, and somatic symptoms e.g. “I am so unhappy/sad that I can’t stand it”. Four response op- tions exist, which reflect increasing levels of depressive symptomatology. The HAMD17 and BDI total scores range from 0 to 52 and from 0 to 63, respectively, with higher scores reflecting stronger depressive symptoms. The reliability and validity of the HAMD17 139, 140 and the BDI are well documented in the scientific literature. Response and remission are defined based on the HAMD17 scores. Response is defined as ≥ 50% de- crease of symptoms from baseline to the endpoint, par- tial response as 25–49% reduction, and non-response as 25% reduction, whereas remission is accomplished if the HAMD17 total score is ≤ 7 . With regard to the BDI, scores between 0 and 9 indicate that a person is not depressed, scores between 10 and 18 reflect mild– moderate depression, scores between 19 and 29 indicate moderate-to-severe depression, and scores ≥ 30 indicate severe depression . Button et al. further sug- gested for the BDI that the MCID is best measured on a ratio scale, with a reduction of 17.5% of the initial scale representing a clinically meaningful change in depressive symptoms. Self-perceived stress Perceived stress will be assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale PSS 144, 145. The 10-item PSS is a well- established self-report measure of stress and is based on the cognitive-transactional stress theory. Answers are given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 never to 5 very often. Evidence for the validity and reliability of the PSS has been reported previously . No MCID scores exist for this measure. Self-perceived health The Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Health Survey SF-12 is used to assess participants’ self- perceived health . This instrument is among the most widely used measures within general population research , and the reliability and validity of the SF- scores of both subscales physical and psychological health are calculated by weighting each item as described in the SF-12 manual. Higher scores reflect in- creased health functioning. A study with low back pain patients suggests that improvements of 3.77 in the psy- chological subscale and of 3.29 in the physical subscale can be regarded as suitable MCID scores . Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 Insomnia symptoms Sleep complaints are assessed with the seven-item In- somnia Severity Index ISI . Answers are given on a 5-point rating scale, ranging from 0 not at all to 4 very much. Evidence for the reliability and validity of this instrument has been documented previously 153, 154. These items are in line with DSM-IV criteria for insomnia and include symptoms such as difficulties fall- ing asleep, difficulties maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, low daytime increased daytime sleepiness, performance, low satisfaction with sleep, and worrying about sleep. Higher scores reflect a higher level of sleep complaints. Scores of 0–7 indicate absence of insomnia, scores of 8–14 indicate subthreshold insomnia, scores of 15–21 indicate moderate insomnia, and scores of 22–28 indicate severe insomnia . Cognitive function Today, there is no gold standard regarding the assess- ment of cognitive and executive function . With re- gard to cognitive function, we decided to apply an odd- ball paradigm, the two-back test, and the Flanker task to assess sustained attention, working memory, and inhib- ition, respectively. The odd-ball paradigm requires participants to press a button to deviants, which appear with a lower frequency 25% than standard stimuli 75%. In the two-back task , participants are instructed to identify whether or not the presented letter matches the one presented two trials before by pressing a button corresponding to yes or no. Lastly, the Flanker task requires participants to respond to the direc- tion of a centrally presented arrow and to ignore the flanking arrows, which either point in the same or the opposite direction. These computer-based cognitive tests are well recognized neuropsychological tests for asses- sing attention and executive function , and have been found to be reliable tools in previous research 161–163. In the present study, the cognitive tasks will be administered with E-Prime 3.0 PST, USA. Separately for each test, the reaction time on response-correct tri- als and accuracy will be extracted for statistical analyses. No established MCID scores exist for this measure. Blood pressure Systolic SBP and diastolic DBP blood pressure will be measured after the participant has rested for 5 min while seated. Blood pressure is taken twice within 5 min with the Omron® digital blood pressure monitor. A cuff size appropriate to the arm circumference of the participants will be chosen. Evidence for the validity of Omron® oscil- lometric blood pressure measurement devices has been reported previously . Reductions in SBP and DBP of 2 mmHg are considered meaningful MCID scores . Participants will be considered hypertensive if they have SBP scores of ≥ 140 mmHg and DBP scores of ≥ 90 mmHg . Body mass index, percentage of body fat, and waist circumference Body weight will be measured with a digital weighing scale BC-545; Tanita, USA without shoes to the near- est 0.1 kg, in light clothes. To measure height, each par- ticipant will stand against a stadiometer without shoes. Body height will be taken to the nearest 0.5 cm. BMI will be calculated with the following formula: weight kg / standing height m2. Based on WHO standards , participants will be classified as overweight if their BMI is ≥ 25.0 kg/m2, and as obese with a BMI of ≥ 30.0 kg/m2. Following an expert consensus , 5% weight loss is considered the MCID among people classified as overweight or obese. The BC-545 weighing scale can also be used for bioelectrical impedance analysis to as- sess percentage body fat. With regard to healthy body fat, the WHO recommends maximum levels of ≥ 32% for women and ≥ 25% for men. In the present study, a reduction of 2% is defined as the MCID for percentage body fat . A flexible tape at the natural waist half- way between the ribcage and the iliac crest is used to determine waist circumference. The expert panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program defines a waist circumference of ≥ 80 cm women and ≥ 94 cm men as a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1c To perform blood tests, venous blood is drawn between 07:00 and 08:30 after fasting since 22:00 the day before by a trained nurse. For the assessment of blood lipid profiles total cholesterol TC, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol HDL-C, and triglycerides TG and HbA1c, blood samples will be analysed via the Afinion test Alere Technologies; Abbott, Wädenswil, Switzerland. One drop of blood will be taken up by the test strip and read by the machine. Good correspondence exists between the Alere point-of-care PAC analyser results and refer- ence laboratory tests for HbA1c and lipid levels 171, 172. Following Rodondi et al. , the following clinic- ally relevant cut-off values should be considered for total cholesterol ≥ 5.6 mmol/l, HDL-C ≤ 1.41 mmol/l, and LDL-C ≥ 3.40 mmol/l. To our knowledge, no officially established MCID score exists for cholesterol levels, al- though some authors suggested considering a 10% in- crease in HDL-C and a 10% decrease in LDL-C as a meaningful the American Diabetes Association and the WHO , HbA1c scores of 5.7–6.4% point towards pre-diabetes, whereas scores of ≥ 6.5% can be used as diagnostic cut-off point . Following score Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 for diabetes, and reductions of ≥ 0.5% are generally con- sidered the MCID for type 2 diabetes . Brain-derived neurotrophic factor Serum BDNF levels will be determined in dupli- cate with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay BDNF Emax Immunoassay System; Promega, USA. This method showed intra- and inter-assay variation co- efficients of 6.0 and 8.5%, respectively . No MCID scores exist for this measure. Tumour necrosis factor alpha The solid-phase Enzyme Amplified Sensitivity Immuno- assay TNF-α ELISA from DRG Switzerland will be used to assess TNF-α . The assay uses monoclonal antibodies mAbs directed against distinct epitopes of TNF-α. The amount of substrate turnover is determined colourimetrically by measuring the absorbance, which is proportional to the TNF-α concentration. No MCID scores exist for this measure. Insulin-like growth factor 1 The DRG IGF-I 600 ELISA Kit DRG, a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA, based on the principle of competitive binding, will be used to as- sess IGF-1 . Patient samples, standards, and con- trols are acidified and neutralized prior to the assay procedure. No MCID scores exist for this measure. Moderator Serotonin transporter gene 5-HTTLPR To assess the 5-HTTLPR genotype at baseline, 9 ml EDTA blood is collected from each participant pa- tients and controls. Within 2 h the blood sample is cen- trifuged without a break at 2500 × g for 10 min at room temperature to separate the cellular components. White blood cells are enriched in the resulting intermediate layer, which is carefully transferred to a reaction tube and stored at − 20 °C for no longer than 4 weeks prior to further processing. The next steps involve DNA extrac- tion according to the manufacturer’s instructions using Quiagen, the QUIAamp DNA blood mini Switzerland, 5-HTTLPR-specific DNA amplification using GoTaq Polymerase and the Promega PCR Master Mix Promega, and the following 5-HTTLPR primers: forward, GGC GTT GCC GCT CTG AAT GC anneal- ing temperature 66 °C; and reverse, GAG GGA CTG AGC TGG ACA ACC AC annealing temperature 74 °C. After completion of the PCR, the products are electrophoretically evaluated. kit The four afore-mentioned biochemical and genetic analyses for BDNF, TNF-α, IGF-1, and 5-HTTLPR will be performed at the Neurobiological Laboratory of the Psychiatric University Clinics Basel Prof. Anne Eckert. Covariates The following variables will be assessed as potential co- variates. Based on participants’ self-reports, we will as- language, nationality, marital sess their gender, age, status, level of education, employment rate prior to hospitalization, years of job experience, smoking status, and the number of children living at home. In addition, interview with the treating psych- based on a clinical iatrist, we will assess information regarding duration of the current depressive episode, number of prior depres- sive episodes, age of onset of depression, and current medication. Qualitative data assessment A nested qualitative study will be carried out using semi-structured interviews to assess the experience and acceptability of the intervention for the patients. All in- terviews will be tape-recorded, transcribed, and analysed with qualitative content analysis . Moreover, the physical activity facilitator will register the number of hours needed for the counselling of each patient. As a result, we will be able to calculate the costs that need to be covered by a clinic if a trained professional is employed to facilitate physical activity adoption and maintenance. To assess cost-effectiveness of a physical activity intervention, Baxter et al. and Chalder et al. used a similar procedure in a previous study. Data collection and statistical analysis Types of data to be collected include: quantitative data on social and demographic background, anthropometric measurements, physical activity, cardiorespiratory fit- ness, exercise-related variables cognitive and social de- terminants, functioning, indicators of psychological cardiovascular risk factors, and biomarkers of MDD; and qualitative data, based on semi-structured interviews, on the acceptability and perceived usefulness of the inter- vention among the patients. The collected data will be entered and merged into a single datafile. Statistical ana- lysis will be performed using SPSS. Treatment group, age, gender, baseline HAMD17 score, and the amount of previous depressive episodes will be selected as covariables. Changes in outcome vari- ables over the three time points will be analysed using repeated-measures analyses of covariance rANCOVAs, with a between-subject factor group IG vs PCG and a within-subject factor time baseline, post intervention, follow-up. If significant group or time interactions are present, Bonferroni-adjusted post-hoc tests will be per- formed to identify individual differences. The statistical significance level will be defined at α = 0.05. Effect sizes will be calculated according to the recommendations of Cohen , with 0.49 ≥ d ≥ 0.20 indicating small effect importance, 0.79 ≥ d ≥ 0.50 e.g. negligible practical Gerber et al. Trials 2019 20:367 indicating medium effect moderate practical import- ance, and d ≥ 0.80 indicating large effect crucial prac- tical importance. In the case of missing values e.g. when patients drop out before follow-up, all analyses will be performed with and without intention to treat . After a thorough dropout analysis, a decision will be reached regarding the method best suited to analyse intention-to-treat ef- fects e.g. last observation carried forward, imputation of missing values . Data monitoring and publishing of data The sponsor-investigator will have monitoring visits at each site prior to the start and during the course of the intervention, to assure standardization across all four centres. Any observed discrepancies will be documented and further procedure discussed. of the state counselling an agreement regarding potential Furthermore, we will provide every fourth month a re- port to an external person Prof. Uwe Pühse, Head Div- ision Sport and Health Pedagogy, DSBG, University of Basel regarding the recruitment quote, number of per- formed post- sessions, intervention and follow-up data assessments, and the dropout quote. In case of insufficient progress of the study, counter- measures will be sought within the data monitoring committee consisting of the external monitor UP, the sponsor-investigator, and the responsible researchers of the four clinics JB, MH, CI, UL. The data monitoring committee will also coordinate the interim analysis and the international dissemination of the study results through presentations at national and international con- ferences and publications in peer-reviewed literature primarily open access. The data monitoring committee will further decide which researchers beyond those listed as co-authors in the present publication will have access to the final trial dataset. In agreement with the other members of the data monitoring committee, the sponsor-investigator has the right to terminate the study prematurely according to certain circumstances, includ- ing ethical concerns, insufficient participant recruitment, when the safety of the participants is doubtful or at risk, respectively, alterations in accepted clinical practice that make the continuation of the trial unwise, and early evi- dence of experimental intervention. benefit or harm of the At the end of the study, the results will be communi- cated to relevant healthcare professionals, the public, and other relevant institutions/groups. Safety All serious adverse reactions SAEs and adverse events AEs that occur during the study will be immediately reported to the sponsor-investigator. More specifically, during the entire duration of the study, all AEs and all SAEs will be collected, fully investigated, and docu- mented in source documents and case report forms. The study duration encompasses the time from when the participant signs the informed consent until the last protocol-specific procedure has been completed, includ- ing a safety follow-up period. The sponsor-investigator will ensure obtaining required insurance coverage for the trial under applicable laws. Schedule and milestones Recruitment of patients started in January 2019. Each study centre treats approximately 150 patients per year. Assuming a recruitment rate of approximately 25%, inclu- sion will stop in January 2021, with follow-up assessments ending in January 2022. Recruitment of healthy controls started in January 2019 and will last until January 2020. An approximate schedule is presented in Table 1. Discussion People with mental illnesses are especially vulnerable to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases primarily caused by a sedentary lifestyle.

Trials 2019 20:367 activity counselling may increase lifestyle physical activ- ity and cardiorespiratory fitness in a particularly vulner- able population which often suffers from a mix of mental and physical health problems. Improving physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness may have important implications for tackling metabolic and cardiovascular disease and increasing cognitive functioning in this at- risk population, hence reducing the future burden of multiple chronic conditions. Increased physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness may also reduce the likeli- hood of future depressive episodes. By moving towards the primary prevention of chronic physical conditions, much can be done to enhance the quality and quantity of life of people with MDD. These findings may strengthen the evidence for “exer- cise as medicine” as a holistic care option in routine clinical practice for people with MDD, by helping pa- tients to adopt and maintain physically active lifestyles after the end of their hospital stay. The study can show feasible ways to achieve long-term behaviour change by integrating physical activity and exercise counselling in given clinical structures. Moreover, the study will show whether such an approach is acceptable for in-patients treated for MDD, and how much financial resources are needed to systematically implement lifestyle physical ac- tivity counselling.
