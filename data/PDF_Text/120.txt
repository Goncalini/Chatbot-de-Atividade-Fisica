Objectives We systemically reviewed published studies that evaluated aerobic exercise interventions in patients with knee osteoarthritis OA to: 1 report the frequency, intensity, type and time FITT of exercise prescriptions and 2 quantify the changes in markers of cardiovascular health and systemic inflammation. Data sources PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus; inception to January 2019. Eligibility criteria Randomised clinical trials RCT, cohort studies, case series. Design We summarised exercise prescriptions for all studies and calculated effect sizes with 95% CIs for between- group RCTs that compared exercise and control groups and within- group pre- post exercise differences in aerobic capacity VO2, heart rate HR, systolic blood pressure SBP, diastolic blood pressure DBP and inflammatory markers interleukin-6 IL-6, tumour necrosis factor- alpha. We pooled results where possible using random effects models. Results Interventions from 49 studies were summarised; 8% 4/49 met all FITT guidelines; 16% 8/49 met all or most FITT guidelines. Fourteen studies 10 RCTs reported at least one marker of cardiovascular health or systemic inflammation. Mean differences 95% CI indicated a small to moderate increase in VO2 0.84 mL/min/kg; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.31, decrease in HR −3.56 beats per minute; 95% CI −5.60 to −1.52 and DBP −4.10 mm Hg; 95% CI −4.82 to −3.38 and no change in SBP −0.36 mm Hg; 95% CI −3.88 to 3.16 and IL-6 0.37 pg/mL; 95% CI −0.11 to 0.85. Within- group differences were also small to moderate. Conclusions In studies of aerobic exercise in patients with knee OA, very few interventions met guideline- recommended dose; there were small to moderate changes in markers of cardiovascular health and no decrease in markers of systemic inflammation. These findings question whether aerobic exercise is being used to its full potential in patients with knee OA.

Aerobic exercise is recommended for chronic diseases because of its ability to improve multiple physio- logical impairments,13 15 16 and does so in a dose- related manner; higher frequency and intensity of exercise improves cardiovascular health,17 18 expends calories19 and reduces chronic inflamma- tion.20 21 The American College of Sports Medicine ACSM provides guidelines for aerobic exercise prescription expressed as the frequency, intensity, type and time FITT principle online supplemen- tary table 1.22 Exercise programmes of various types ie, aerobic, strength, neuromuscular reduce pain and increase function immediately after treatment in patients with knee OA,23 24 but the effects of aerobic exercise beyond musculoskeletal outcomes are unclear.23 25 Despite strong physiological rationale for aerobic interventions, the exercise prescriptions and changes in markers of cardiovascular health and systemic inflammation have not been systemat- ically reviewed in patients with knee OA. Therefore, we systemically reviewed published studies in patients with knee OA that evaluated the effect of aerobic exercise interventions to: 1 report the exercise prescriptions according to the FITT principle and 2 quantify the changes in markers of cardiovascular health and systemic inflammation.

Eligibility criteria We included randomised clinical trials RCT, cohort studies and case series that evaluated an aerobic exercise intervention strictly aerobic or mixed interventions that included an aerobic portion in patients diagnosed with knee OA tibiofemoral and/ or patellofemoral; unilateral and/or bilateral. The interven- tions were considered aerobic as defined by ACSM; a mode of physical activity that results in improvement and maintenance of cardiorespiratory function, including walking, running, swimming, cycling and dancing.22 Studies must have compared outcome measures to a control group between- group or pre- post aerobic exercise within- group. Search We searched PubMed, CINAHL and Scopus from database inception to January 2019. The search terms included Osteo- arthritis AND knee OR knees OR knee joint OR knee joints AND exercise OR aerobic OR walk OR walking OR run OR running OR cycle OR cycling OR jog OR jogging OR swim OR swimming OR dance OR dancing. Additionally, we manu- ally searched reference lists from previous systematic reviews. Studies were restricted to those written in either English or French. Eight reviewers four pairs independently examined one- quarter of the titles and abstracts and classified each to exclude or retrieve for full- text review, using Covidence Covi- dence systematic review software, Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia, www. covidence. org. The same eight reviewers independently assessed full- text articles for eligibility. One reviewer JMS instructed all other reviewers on study eligi- bility titles, abstracts and full- text review and data extraction procedures. If the decision regarding eligibility differed among any pair, the same reviewer JMS consulted with the pair to reach consensus. Data extraction Each reviewer individually extracted data for: study design, age, sex, body mass index BMI, OA diagnosis ie, radiographic and Kellgren and Lawrence grade if provided and/or symptomatic OA and characteristics of the exercise programme including type of exercise, frequency sessions/week, intensity heart rate %HRmax/aerobic capacity %VO2max/heart rate reserve %HRR/rating of perceived exertion, time minutes/session, including warm- up and cool down, duration of intervention number of weeks, presence of a supervisor and the extent to which ACSM criteria were met. For studies that reported a marker of cardiovascular health or systemic inflammation, we extracted the method used to assess the outcome and associated statistics for preintervention and postintervention scores in all groups and subgroups involved. For all studies, unadjusted mean differences MD were extracted, unless reported otherwise two RCTs28 29 reported adjusted means. Reported markers of cardiovascular health included VO2 mL/min/mm Hg, HR beats per minute; bpm, systolic blood pressure SBP; mm Hg and diastolic blood pres- sure DBP; mm Hg. Reported markers of systemic inflammation included interleukin-6 IL-6; pg/mL and tumour necrosis factor- alpha TNF-α; pg/mL. Additionally, as the 6 min walk test 6MWT metres is a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness and musculoskeletal health, we evaluated it separately and included it in online supplementary appendix 1. Study authors were Risk of bias We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Risk of Bias in Non- randomized Studies of Interventions to rate the quality of RCTs and non- RCTs, respectively.30 31 The reviewers inde- pendently assessed each study using the same procedures described above, so that risk of bias for each study was rated by two reviewers and the same third reviewer JMS consulted to reach consensus for any discrepancies. Quality of the studies was ranked as ‘low’, ‘some’ and ‘high’ bias based on the following study design factors: randomisation, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of outcome and selection of the reported result. Additionally, bias due to confounding, in the selection of participants and in the classifi- cation of the intervention, was rated for non- RCTs. An overall risk rating for the study was estimated from the individual risks of each domain. A weighted kappa κw for inter- rater agreement was calculated for each pair of reviewers before discrepancies were resolved SPSS V.23, IBM. We also used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation GRADE to rate the overall quality of evidence in the system- atic reviews,32 and the Template for Intervention Descrip- tion and Replication to aid in the description of the exercise interventions.33 Synthesis of results We calculated the raw MD and 95% CIs for each study and pooled data using random effects meta- analyses. We first anal- ysed between- group differences ie, aerobic exercise intervention vs control from RCTs. We then analysed within- group ie, pre- post aerobic exercise paired differences for all study designs. All but one study28 provided preintervention and postintervention or change data. When not reported, the SD was estimated from the SE of the mean, 95% CI, p value or other methods suggested in the Cochrane Handbook.27 Means and SDs were estimated from median and range for two studies.34 Following Cochrane guide- lines, for any study that included two different intervention groups ie, cycling vs walking and one control group, the sample size in the control group was evenly divided so a comparison could be made to each intervention.27 We imputed r=0.5 when the correlation of prescores and postscores was required and we performed sensitivity analyses using r values ranging from and p values, where an absence of inconsistency was repre- sented as 0%, less than 40% was considered low, 30%–60% was moderate, 50%–90% was substantial, 75%–100% was consid- erable and 100% indicated maximal inconsistency ie, high heterogeneity.37 Additional subgroup and sensitivity analyses were planned based on a priori hypotheses described in online supplementary appendix 1. Meta- analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta- Analysis software program V.3, Biostat.

All non- RCTs had a high risk of bias for confounding, and most 8/11, 72% had a high risk for inter- vention classification. Patient and personnel blinding was not possible in all studies; however, most had inappropriate methods to control for confounding variables or did not blind outcome assessors. All studies had a ‘low’ risk for participant selection bias, because selection was not based on characteristics observed after the start of the study. Overall, most studies 36/49, 74% had a ‘high’ risk of bias, 9 18% had a ‘low’ risk of bias and 4 8% had ‘some’ risk of bias online supplementary table 3, online supplementary figure 1. Additionally, all studies rated low in the quality of evidence according to GRADE. Markers of cardiovascular health and systemic inflammation Synthesis of results comparing aerobic exercise to control Between- group RCT analyses MD, 95% CI indicated a statis- tically significant increase in VO2 0.84 mL/min/kg; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.3, decrease in HR −3.56 bpm; 95% CI −5.60 to –1.52 and decrease in DBP −4.10 mm Hg; 95% CI −4.82 to –3.38, p0.05 figure 2A,B,D. There were no statistically significant differences in SBP −0.36 mm Hg; 95% CI –3.88 to 3.16 and IL-6 0.37 pg/mL; 95% CI −0.11 to 0.85; p0.05 figure 2C,E. Synthesis of results comparing pre-aerobic to post-aerobic exercise The within- group pre- post exercise analyses indicated a statis- tically significant increase in VO2 1.69 mL/min/kg; 95% CI –2.25 and decrease in SBP −7.19 mm Hg; 95% CI −11.40 to –2.25 and DBP −4.66 mm Hg; 95% CI −6.03 to –3.28 online supplementary appendix 1; figure 2A–D.

Fourteen studies reported a marker of cardiovascular health and/or systemic inflammation and were included in various meta- analyses. For between- group analyses, 10 RCTs that included a control group were included online supplementary table 2. Four studies compared VO2, three compared HR, two compared SBP and DBP and three compared IL-6. For within- group analyses, all study types were included. In total, five studies reported VO2, four reported HR, three reported SBP and DBP, five reported IL-6 and four reported TNF-α online supplementary table 3. Participant and intervention characteristics A total of 3448 patients were included for objective 1 76% female, age=63±7 years; BMI=29.3±4.9 kg/m2; mean±SD. Three studies39 40 44 where patients had OA at multiple joints were included because over 60% of the participants had knee OA online supplementary table 2. Comparison to ACSM guidelines for aerobic exercise Interventions in 2 of the 49 studies 4% met all domains of the ACSM FITT criteria, and another two46 64 met the criteria progressively over time, whereby the duration ie, minutes/ session and/or intensity ie, %HRmax/VO2max increased as the intervention advanced forward. Therefore, all domains were met by the end of the intervention 4/49, 8%. Interventions in another four studies 8%29 69 70 72 met three of the FITT criteria recommended by ACSM, with the exception of 150 min of aerobic exercise/week. Therefore, 8/49 16% met all or most of the criteria. All exercise interventions were classified as moderate intensity or less according to ACSM criteria online supplementary table 1. The overall average patient adherence to the intervention was 86%, measured by attendance or dropout online supplementary table 3. DISCuSSIOn What are the aerobic exercise prescriptions studied in patients with knee OA? Only 16% 8/49 of published studies in patients with knee OA evaluated interventions that met all or most of the ACSM guidelines for aerobic exercise prescription. Most interven- tions reviewed 45/49, 92% did not meet the target of 150 min/week of moderate to vigorous activity. Additionally, most studies 40/49, 82% did not measure HR or VO2 to ensure patients were exercising at the target intensity. Several exercise programmes 22/49, 45% were less than 12 weeks; durations ranged from 4 to 78 weeks online supplementary table 2. Most studies had a ‘high’ risk of bias online supplementary table 3, online supplementary figure 1; and all studies rated low in the quality of evidence according to GRADE. Risk of bias There was substantial agreement on items with the exception of bias in the selection of participants and bias in the reporting of results for non- RCTs, requiring the third reviewer to reach consensus p0.05, κw ranging from 0.13 to 0.75. For RCTs, 45% 17/38 of studies had ‘high’ risk for measurement bias. Most studies had ‘low’ or ‘some’ risk for selection, performance Why are the interventions not meeting recommended dose? We suggest the likely reasons the studied interventions did not strictly follow aerobic exercise guidelines include the perceived lack of ability for patients with knee OA to adhere to the guide- lines, the fear of exacerbating symptoms and increasing adverse events and/or the desire to limit patients from dropping out.

Therefore, patients and their health providers must adjust guideline parameters to meet individual patient needs.84 Other recently published meta- analyses suggest that patients with knee OA do not experience increased pain with exercise,24 and that knee loading with exercise is not harmful to the articular cartilage.85 Therefore, published exercise prescription guidelines are recommended to guide exercise inter- ventions for people with OA.86 Aerobic exercise in patients for other chronic diseases has been able to meet ACSM guidelines. In patients with type 2 diabetes, higher intensities of aerobic exercise resulted in greater improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness.87 A recent systematic review of the effects of aerobic exercise for patients with meta- bolic syndrome only included studies with interventions that met the FITT criteria. It reported substantial improvements in HR, SBP and VO2, with vigorous intensity interventions providing greater effects.88 What are the effects on markers of cardiovascular health and systemic inflammation? Only 14 of the studies 29% evaluated the effects of aerobic exercise using a marker of cardiovascular health or systemic i l a r t e c h n o o g i e s . l B r J S p o r t s M e d : f i r s t p u b l i . / j s h e d a s b s p o r t s - - o n D e c e m b e r . l D o w n o a d e d f r o m h t t p : / / b j s m b m . j . c o m / o n A p r i l , b y g u e s t .

Meta- analyses of those results indicated only small to moderate improvements in VO2, HR and DBP online supplementary appendix 1; figure 2. Although some of these improvements may arguably be clinically important, they are less than typically observed following aerobic exercise interven- tions and are likely to fall short in evoking optimal effects for patients with knee OA. As administered in the studies reviewed, the aerobic exercise interventions did not decrease circulating inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-α online supplementary appendix 1; figure 2. When ACSM guideline- recommended dose is met, aerobic exercise can markedly improve cardiovascular health,89 90 decrease systemic inflammation91 92 and increase caloric expen- diture.19 Such physiological outcomes have potential to affect multiple disease processes linked to OA93–95 and may be reason- ably hypothesised to decrease the risk of progression of knee OA and associated comorbidities. The caveat lies in the proper administration and adherence to aerobic exercise guidelines. Importantly, as suggested by the present data, when patients with OA are not meeting recommended guidelines, optimal improve- ments in cardiovascular health and systemic inflammation do not occur. Without such physiological changes, there may be no concomitant improvement in OA progression or comorbid- ities, and improvements in pain and function may be less than possible. Therefore, the true potential of aerobic exercise as a treatment for knee OA may be unrealised. It is important to acknowledge that despite not meeting ACSM guidelines, the interventions were generally well attended by patients and did provide small to moderate improvements in some markers of cardiovascular health online supplementary appendix 1; figure 2. As studied, the interventions also provided moderate improvements in the 6MWT online supplementary appendix 1; figure 3.The results of the present review do not negate the importance of encouraging patients with knee OA to exercise, even at lower levels than those suggested to evoke optimal changes in cardiovascular health and systemic inflamma- tion, given the other health benefits of physical activity.24 96–99 limitations The present estimates of the within- group pre- post exercise changes online supplementary appendix 1; figure 2 should be interpreted carefully. For these analyses, the true intervention effects may not be discernible from effects caused by the simple passage of time, measurement error and/or characteristics of the patients and setting.100 Similarly, including non- randomised studies may contribute to uncontrolled confounding. Regardless, our between- group and within- group comparisons reveal lower changes in cardiovascular health and systemic inflammation than previously observed in randomised trials of aerobic exercise in patients with other chronic diseases.87 88 The present methods used to determine effect sizes assume normally distributed outcomes within each study and this may not always be the case, especially for the several relatively small studies included in this review. Moreover, although studies reported the same markers, pooled data across all studies were sometimes assessed using slightly different methods ie, calcu- lated max vs peak VO2, using a treadmill protocol vs cycling protocol, and so on. While we reported individual and pooled study effect sizes, and performed sensitivity analyses where possible, results may differ based on study methods. Lastly, few studies reported sex- specific analyses. These should be performed in future, adequately powered studies. Review COnCluSIOnS Despite the strong rationale to improve cardiovascular health and reduce systemic inflammation in patients with knee OA, published studies include aerobic exercise interventions that rarely meet recommended dose guidelines. The pooled results from studies reporting a marker of cardiovascular health or systemic inflammation suggest only small to moderate effects on VO2, HR and blood pressure and no decrease in inflammatory markers. Therefore, clinicians may not be extracting the full potential benefit of aerobic exercise in patients with knee OA. Whether this is the case or not needs to be studied. What is already known ► Knee osteoarthritis OA is associated with systemic inflammation, cardiovascular events and all- cause mortality. ► Aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular health and reduces systemic inflammation—this is a strong rationale for its use in patients with knee OA.

We encourage studies of interventions that evoke more substantial changes in cardiovascular health and systemic inflammation.
