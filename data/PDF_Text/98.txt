Yang et al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act 2022 19:80 Open Access Physical activity and mental health in children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities: a meta-analysis using the RE-AIM framework Wen Yang, Xiao Liang and Cindy Hui‑Ping Sit Abstract Background: Children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities IDs tend to have lower levels of physical activity and poorer mental health than their typically developing peers. Studies on the effects of physical activity on the men‑ tal health of children with IDs using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance RE‑AIM framework are scarce. Methods: A systematic literature review using six databases CINAHL, Eric, PsycINFO, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science was conducted from January 2000 to September 2021. Studies reporting at least one physical activity intervention and mental health outcome in children and adolescents with IDs aged between 5 and 17 years were included in the meta‑analysis. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta‑Analysis guideline, Compre‑ hensive Meta‑Analysis, and the RE‑AIM framework were utilized. 0.542, p 0.01 and large effects on cognitive function 1.236, p 0.01. Randomized controlled trial RCT design and intervention components 120 min‑ Results: A total of 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the meta‑analysis. The effects of physical activity on mental health in children and adolescents with IDs were significant and large Hedges’ g with medium effects on psychological health Hedges’ g Hedges’ g utes per week, therapeutic, and aerobic exercise demonstrated the strongest effects. Moreover, study background publication year, study location, and sample size, participant characteristics age and sex, and Maintenance RE‑AIM framework moderated the effects of physical activity on mental health. Based on the RE‑AIM framework, there were higher proportions in the dimensions of Reach and Effectiveness than Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. 0.897, p 0.01, = = = Conclusions: Physical activity appears to have positive effects on mental health, including psychological health and cognitive function, in children and adolescents with IDs. Physical activity interventions using the RE‑AIM framework are recommended to assess short‑ and long‑term impacts and translate scientific evidence into practice. Trial registration: The protocol for this meta‑analysis was registered with PROSPERO CRD42 02125 6543.

Yang et al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act 2022 19:80 determined using the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-V . Globally, the prevalence of IDs is approximately 1%, with a higher ratio in men than women, with roughly 85% fall- ing within the mild level . Compared to peers with TD, the rate of mental health problems in children and ado- lescents with IDs is three to four times higher 4, 5, and they are more likely to be exposed to socio-economic dis- advantages . According to the World Health Organization WHO, mental health could be determined based on psycho- logical factors, and mental health promotion involves the improvement of psychological health . Psychological health has been used to represent positive and negative feelings in personal and social life, including psychologi- cal well- and ill-being . Mental health includes basic cognitive skills and the ability to cope with function in social roles . Psychological health and cognitive func- tion are important elements of mental health and have gained attention in physical activity studies 10–12. Recent WHO guidelines on physical activity and sed- entary behavior recommended that children and ado- lescents living with a disability should engage in at least activity across the week, with at least three days of vig- orous-intensity aerobic activities per week . Physical activity has been found to have beneficial effects on men- tal health in children and adolescents with disabilities . However, children and adolescents with IDs engage in lower levels of physical activity than their peers with TD 15–17. Previous reviews with meta-analyses indicated that physical activity had positive moderate-to-large effects on psychosocial well-being Hedges’ g = 0.682, p 0.01 and positive influence on emotional problems in children and adolescents with IDs 18, 19. These reviews explored the moderating effects of study background e.g., sample size and study design, participant characteristics e.g., age and ID level, and intervention components e.g., type and setting; however, cognitive function outcomes were under-researched. Moreover, some reviews and meta-analyses reported the effects of physical activity on cognitive function in children and adolescents with other disabilities. For instance, physical activity had positive effects on cognitive function in children and adolescents with social, emotional, and behavioral disabilities . Exercise interventions had positive small-to-moderate effects Hedges’ g = 0.342, p 0.01 on executive func- tion in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder . Exercise had a positive moderate-to-large effect Hedges’ g = 0.611, p 0.01 on cognitive function in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyper- active disorder . Participant characteristics, such as age, and intervention components, such as session and content, moderated the effects of physical activity on cognitive function in children with disabilities 22, 23. Extant studies called for an examination of the moderat- ing effects of sex and intervention duration . Previous reviews indicated the moderating effects of publication year on mental health outcomes in TD popu- lations 24, 25, and social, cultural, and environmental factors were potential barriers to physical activity par- ticipation for children with disabilities . Due to the intellectual impairments in children and adolescents with IDs, their mental health outcomes were self-reported and reported by their teachers and parents simultaneously . Teachers and parents could identify more severe mental health problems than children themselves . However, the moderating roles of publication year, study location, and outcome reporter in the effects of physical activity on mental health were under-explored in chil- dren and adolescents with IDs. Antikainen and Ellis 2011 and McGoey et al. 2015 indicated that the interventions had no long- term follow-up assessments and focused on internal rather than external validity, which may reduce the gen- eralizability to ecological settings 29, 30. The five-step Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance RE-AIM framework 31, 32 has been used to guide physical activity interventions and evaluate external validity of theory-based physical activity inter- ventions 29, 33, 34, and to examine the impact of trans- lational research in the disability research . Several research gaps existed in previous literature. First, while previous systematic reviews with meta-anal- yses examined the effects of physical activity on psycho- logical health in children and adolescents with IDs 18, 19, the effects of physical activity on mental health, including psychological health and cognitive func- tion, in children and adolescents with IDs were under- researched. Second, the quality of previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses in children and adolescents with IDs was evaluated using risk of bias, which showed moderate to high risk 18, 19; however, external validity, such as generalizability or applicability, based on the RE- AIM framework in children and adolescents with IDs was not examined. Third, while previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses in children and adolescents with IDs reported the moderating roles of study background, par- ticipant characteristics, and intervention components using subgroup analyses 18, 19, other moderating effects, such as study location, overcome reporter, and the RE-AIM framework, were under-explored. There- fore, our meta-analysis aimed to 1 determine the effects of physical activity on mental health, including psycho- logical health and cognitive function, in children and Yang et al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act 2022 19:80 adolescents with IDs, 2 evaluate physical activity inter- ventions in children and adolescents with IDs using the RE-AIM framework, and 3 examine the moderating roles of the study background, participant characteristics, intervention components, and the RE-AIM framework. Methods Protocol This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines PRISMA . The PRISMA guidelines contain 27 items see Additional file 1, and a protocol for this meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO CRD42021256543. Search strategy A systematic search was conducted using CINAHL EBSCO, Education Resources Information Center ERIC, EBSCO, PsycINFO OVID, Pubmed NIBI, SPORTDiscus EBSCO, and Web of Science databases on September 10, 2021. The publication date was from January 1, 2000 to September 9, 2021, and the search was conducted by two researchers WY and XL. Four terms were used in the search: 1 intellectual disability, 2 chil- dren and adolescents, 3 physical activity, and 4 mental health. The search strategy for the SPORTDiscus data- base is presented in Additional file 2. Selection procedure and eligibility criteria After all duplicates were removed, two researchers WY and XL independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full text of the search studies. References were imported and uploaded to Endnote X9. The researchers resolved any disagreements through discussion, and a third researcher CHPS deliberated to reach a final decision. The Kappa statistic was calculated fair 0.40–0.59, good 0.60–0.74, and excellent ≥0.75 to evaluate inter- rater reliability . A total of 4879 original articles were obtained from six databases. After 1769 duplicates were removed, 3110 articles remained; however, 3045 arti- cles were excluded after their titles and abstracts were screened, five articles were excluded as reports could not be retrieved, and 60 abstracts met the inclusion criteria with an inter-rater reliability of k = 0.62. A further 46 articles were removed after their full texts were screened for the following reasons: 14 due to study design, 13 due to age, 10 due to intervention components, three due to disability type, two due to outcome, two due to lan- guage, and one each due to publication year and study quality. One article was included via citation searching. Therefore, 15 articles were included, with an inter-rater reliability of k = 0.73. Figure 1 shows the PRISMA flow diagram of the search and screening process. The inclusion and exclusion criteria followed the PICOS framework, which included population, inter- vention, comparison, outcome, and study design . Inclusion criteria for eligible studies were as follows: 1 population of children and adolescents aged between mental disabilities, intellectual impairments, and cogni- tive impairments, 2 intervention being physical activity, sports, exercise, games, and training, 3 comparison of physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, and daily activ- ity, 4 at least one measured and reported outcome on mental health, and 5 study design being intervention, including randomized controlled trial RCT and non- RCT, published in a peer-reviewed journal with full-text in English from January 2000 to September 2021. The exclusion criteria were 1 children and adolescents with developmental disabilities or learning disabilities, 2 lack of comparison groups, 3 observational studies, qualitative studies, or reviews, publication as a confer- ence poster, conference abstract, protocol, or commen- tary, and publication earlier than January 2000. Data extraction Data extraction followed the Cochrane handbook for sys- tematic reviews of interventions . Two researchers extracted data from each of the eligible studies: 1 study background, including name of the first author, publica- tion year, study location, outcome reporter self-report and teacher/parent proxy-report, study design RCT and non-RCT, and sample size, 2 participant charac- teristics, including age, sex, and ID level, 3 interven- tion components, including type, setting, and protocol duration per week, total session, and total duration, 4 measures and outcomes of mental health, including psychological health anxiety, depression, emotional self- control, self-competence, self-esteem withdrawn, and self-worth and cognitive function accuracy, cognitive flexibility, executive function, inhibition control, reaction time, and working memory. Quality assessment The 21-item validated quality evaluation tool based on the RE-AIM framework see Additional file 3 was used to code eligible articles on the degree to which indicators of internal and external validity were reported , and improve the translatability and impact of health inter- ventions . In the RE-AIM framework, Reach refers to the percentage and risk characteristics of participants. A sample question was “What percent of potentially eligible participants were excluded and included, and how representative were they?” Effectiveness indicates the positive and negative consequences of the interven- tion. A sample question was “What are the positive and Yang et al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act 2022 19:80 Fig. 1 The PRISMA flow diagram of the search and screening process negative outcomes for participants, including quality of life?” Adoption is the proportion and representative- ness of intervention personnel and protocol. A sample question was “What percent of settings and intervention agents within these settings were excluded and included, and how representative were they?” Implementation assesses the participants’ adherence to intervention, and the extent to which personnel deliver intervention as intended. A sample question was “To what extent were the various intervention components delivered as intended?” Maintenance evaluates the extent to which the intervention becomes a routine of daily life. A sample question was “What were the long-term effects, and indi- cators of program level maintenance?“ . The quality assessment was conducted by two researchers WY and XL independently. The Kappa statistic values for consist- ency were 0.65 for Reach, 0.63 for Effectiveness, 0.72 for Adoption, 0.67 for Implementation, and 0.82 for Main- tenance, indicating good to excellent inter-rater reliabil- ity. The disagreements were resolved by discussion, and researchers gained consensus in the coding by revisiting the included articles. Meta‑analytic procedures We used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis CMA; ver- sion 3.0 to conduct the meta-analysis. Only studies that reported sufficient statistical data from pre- and post- test in experimental and control groups were included in the meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used to measure heterogeneity distributed effect size, as it uses sample error and between-study variance to estimate effect size . Standardized mean differences SMD for continuous outcomes with different measurement units were calculated and weighted, and the mean M, sample size N, and standard deviation SD were the primary methods for effect size calculations. Hedges’ g and its 95% confidence interval CI were used in this meta-anal- ysis, which could correct the overestimated effect size for small sample size, and Cohen’s d was used for large sam- ple size 22, 39. Effect size values of 0.20 indicates small, size . The statistical heterogeneity I2 was assessed using a p value calculated for Q statistics, indicating small ≤25%, medium 50%, and large ≥75% hetero- geneity . Except for the holistic meta-analyses for Yang et al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act 2022 19:80 mental health, subgroup analyses of psychological health and cognitive function were conducted based on spe- cific outcomes. The meta-regression was used to explore the moderating effects of study background publication year, study location, outcome reporter, study design, and sample size, participant characteristics age, sex, and ID level, intervention components type, setting, duration per week, total session, and total duration, and RE-AIM framework. The presence of outliers was investigated by analyzing relative residual values of included studies, and a stand- ard score z-score more than or equal to a positive or negative value of 1.96 was considered a large residual value . A sensitivity analysis i.e., one study removed procedure in CMA software was used to inspect the impact of retention/removal of outliers and their influ- ence on the overall effect size. Studies should be retained when the overall effect size after removal remains signifi- cant and within the 95% CI . To decrease potential publication bias, a funnel plot calculating the standard error and effect size was used, and Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill method i.e., random-effects model was utilized to measure the publication-bias adjusted effect size and the number of studies required to balance the plot . In addition, Begg and Mazumdar rank correla- tion and Egger’s regression intercept were performed to test for publication bias . A statistical significance of p 0.05 was set for all tests. Results Characteristics of included studies Table 1 shows the descriptive characteristics of the 15 included studies. There were a total of 630 participants, with 313 participants involved in trials of psychological health, and the remaining 317 cognitive function. Of 15 included articles, nine 43–51 studies 60% examined psychological health, and six 52–57 40% cognitive function. As for measures of mental health, six 43–48 studies 40% focused on psychological well-being using the Checklist for Pupil Evaluation and Self-perception Profile, three 49–51 studies 20% measured psycho- logical ill-being using Child Behavior Checklist, 12-item Anxiety/Depression Scale, and Withdrawn Behavior Checklist, five 53–57 studies 33.3% used reaction time measurements, such as Cognitive Performance, and two 52, 54 studies 13.3% used Flanker test inhibition con- trol, Go/No-Go test accuracy, NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery working memory, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test-64 card version executive function. The sample size ranged from 20 to 132 participants with a mean age of 13.16 years, including five 43, 51, 52, 54, 55 studies 40% with children 5–11 years and 12–17 years . Regarding sex, six 44, 45, 49–51, 53 studies 40% included all male participants, three 46– 48 studies 20% all female participants, and six 43, 52, 54–57 studies 40% included men and women. Mental health outcomes in 12 studies 44–48, 51–57 80% were self-reported, and the other three studies 43, 49, 50 20% used reports provided by teachers or parents. Nine studies 43, 45, 49, 50, 52–55, 57 60% adopted the RCT design, and six 44, 46–48, 51, 56 studies 40% employed non-RCT design. Ten studies 44–50, 53, 56, 57 66.7% were conducted in Europe five in France, two in Turkey, and one each in Greece, Germany, and Servia, three 43, 52, 55 20% in Asia one each in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and India, and one each 51, 54 13.3% in America and Australia. As for the identification of the ID, eight studies 44, 45, 47–50, 52, 53 53.3% used Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children , two studies 46, 57 13.3% used American Association on Mental Retardation , two studies 51, 54 13.3% followed the DSM-V criteria , and one study 6.7% followed the American Asso- ciation on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities . Four studies 43, 44, 52, 57 26.7% focused on mild ID, eight studies 45–48, 50, 53–55 53.3% focused on mild to moderate ID, and three studies 49, 51, 56 20% focused on overall ID. Collectively, eight studies 44–50, 52 53.3% were conducted in community settings, such as Special Olym- pics, and five studies 43, 51, 53, 54, 56 33.3% were con- ducted in schools. There were five types of intervention: six studies 44–48, 50 40% used competitive sports, such as basketball, swimming, and soccer, three studies 54, 55, 57 20% used cognitive exercise, such as fitness training and yoga, three studies 43, 52, 53 20% used therapeutic exercise, two studies 49, 51 13.3% used non-competitive sports, such as unified sports soccer, and two studies 52, 56 13.3% used aerobic exercise, such as cycling. For intervention protocol, nine studies 43, 45, 48–53, 57 60% conducted interventions less than 50 sessions in total, and five studies 44, 46, 47, 54, 55 33.3% ≥50 intervention sessions in total. Further- more, nine studies 44–48, 50, 53, 54, 57 60% included training of ≤120 minutes per week, and five studies 43, 49, 51, 52, 55 33.3% used training of 120 minutes per week. The total intervention duration ranged from Quality assessment Table 2 shows the proportion of physical activity inter- ventions reporting components of the RE-AIM frame- work. The total score of the RE-AIM framework was 40.5%, and among the five dimensions, Reach showed the highest proportion 76%, followed by Effectiveness 56.7%, Implementation 37.8%, Adoption 23.3%, Yang et al.

Children and adolescents with IDs who exercised more than 120 minutes per week Hedges’ g = 1.244, p 0.01 had better mental health outcomes than those who exercised ≤120 minutes per week Hedges’ g = 0.654, p 0.01. Intervention settings, such as school Hedges’ g = 0.932, p 0.01 and community Hedges’ g = 0.764, p 0.01, had significant and positive effects on mental health. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias Eight studies 43, 48, 50–53, 55, 57 were found to be outliers z-score ranged from 2.269 to 8.233, and “one study removed” sensitivity analysis was performed. Results showed that all pooled outcomes were stable to the sequential removal of outliers Hedges’ g ranged from the 95% CI. Therefore, these eight studies were retained in the final analysis. The funnel plot of publication bias is illustrated in Fig. 3. Based on Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill method, publication-bias adjusted effect size was 0.924 95% CI 0.806, 1.042, and no studies were needed to balance the plot. The results of Begg and Mazumdar’s z = 0.438, p 0.05 and Egger’s tests intercept = − 0.987, 95% CI − 4.189, 2.215, p 0.05 indicated that the con- clusion of the meta-analysis was not susceptible to publi- cation bias. Discussion Our meta-analysis demonstrated that physical activity had significant and large effects on mental health in chil- dren and adolescents with IDs, with medium effects on psychological health and large effects on cognitive func- tion. Similarly, previous reviews found medium effects of physical activity on psychosocial health in children with IDs and working memory in children and adoles- cents with learning disabilities . Possible mechanisms of the effects of physical activity on mental health may be explained by physiological reasons, such as physi- cal activity benefitting mental function , modulating neuroinflammation, inhibiting neuronal integrity, and enhancing neurotrophin levels, neurogenesis, and vas- cularization . A review noted that physical activity might induce change in neurological, psychological, and behavioral parameters, such as increased neural activity within the prefrontal cortex and the functional activity of monoamines related to mood, and improved coping efficacy through the mediation of hippocampal neuro- genesis activity and activation of the hypothalamic-pitu- itary-adrenal axis . In our meta-analysis, intervention components 120 minutes per week, therapeutic, and aerobic exer- cise were moderators in the effects of physical activ- ity on mental health in children and adolescents with Fig. 3 Funnel plot for visual inspection of publication bias Yang et al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act 2022 19:80 IDs, which was consistent with previous reviews. For instance, high intervention frequency was more effec- tive than low intervention frequency, and combined exercise interventions were more effective than non- aerobic exercise on cognitive function in persons with IDs . Intervention type, such as resistance train- ing, was found to have large effects on mental health in children and adolescents with IDs . Therapeutic exercise has received some attention for mental health problems in children and adolescents with IDs; how- ever, evidence is insufficient and inconclusive . intervention setting had no moderating Although effects, interventions conducted in schools and com- munities had positive effects on mental health in chil- dren and adolescents with IDs in this meta-analysis. Previous studies indicated that intervention setting was a moderator in physical activity intervention . School settings had significant effects on physical activ- ity in children with IDs . School environments were found to affect physical activity levels in children with IDs, and they were more active at schools where sup- port for physical activity was available . Therefore, more school-based intervention studies are required to improve the mental health of children and adolescents with IDs. Our meta-analysis also indicated that study back- ground, such as publication year and sample size, were significant moderators, and RCT design had larger effects compared with non-RCT design, which were consistent with the findings in TD populations 24, 25. Intervention studies with more rigorous designs on physical activity and its effects on mental health in chil- dren and adolescents with IDs are required. Moreover, study location had significant moderating effects, and it reflected different cultures and social values, which could be potential barriers to physical activity par- ticipation for children with disabilities . Outcome reporter did not have any moderating effects; however, a previous study found that teacher or parent report- ers could identify more severe mental health problems . Multiple informants, such as clinicians, teachers, and parents, are important to assess the actual effects of physical activity on mental health. Using the RE-AIM framework, we found that the dimensions of Reach and Effectiveness had higher pro- portions than Adoption, Implementation, and Main- tenance, which was consistent with previous reviews using the RE-AIM framework in physical activity inter- ventions in TD populations 30, 33, 66. We also found that Maintenance was a significant moderator in the effects of physical activity on mental health, with only two studies assessing long-term follow-up. Previous studies also recommended long-term and sustainable physical activity participation and scalable interven- tions for children and adolescents with disabilities . To improve the quality of physical activity interven- tions in children and adolescents with IDs, particularly in Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance, the following approaches are suggested: 1 reporting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and adoption rate of deliv- ery agent/setting, 2 calculating costs of equipment and personnel, 3 adding follow-up assessments that occur at least 6 months after the completion of physical activity interventions, and 4 reporting the degree of sustaining the physical activity interventions . In our meta-analysis, ID level had no moderating effects, whereas previous studies showed that ID level moderated physical activity outcomes and was a strong predictor in participants who achieved WHO physical activity guidelines . A previous study revealed that children with a more severe ID level were more sedentary and had less physical activity participa- tion than those with a lower ID level . The reason for the discrepancy may be that this study only included par- ticipants with mild ID, mild to moderate ID, and overall ID. Moreover, age and sex had moderating effects, which were consistent with previous studies . Future studies should recruit more participants with severe or profound ID, and consider the mental age and sex distribution of children and adolescents with IDs. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first meta- analysis using the RE-AIM framework that examined the effects of physical activity on mental health in chil- dren and adolescents with IDs. Some limitations must be addressed. First, there was a lack of evidence on the dimensions of Adoption, Implementation, and Mainte- nance. These three dimensions should be identified in future research to enhance the quality of physical activ- ity interventions. Although all included studies reported at least one follow-up, only two studies assessed the out- comes ≥6 months post intervention, which suggested the need for more robust strategies to keep participants engaged in physical activity intervention and improve the extent to which intervention becomes a routine of daily life. Second, no studies focused on severe or profound ID, which may limit the generalizability of the study. Third, most included studies had small sample size, highlight- ing the urgent need for future physical activity interven- tion studies to include more participants and those with severe or profound ID. Fourth, the social value connected with physical activity may vary between cultures, future research should consider the racial or cultural character- istics of physical activity and mental health. Fifth, physi- cal activity interventions included diverse contents, such as basketball, swimming, soccer, fitness training, yoga, and cycling, but the recommended intervention contents Yang et al. Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act 2022 19:80 and participants’ feedback were under-investigated. Future studies should collect feedback from participants and target effective and preferred contents of physical activity interventions in children and adolescents with IDs. Conclusions Our meta-analysis indicated that physical activity appears to have positive effects on mental health, including psy- chological health and cognitive function, in children and adolescents with IDs. RCT design and intervention components 120 minutes per week, therapeutic, and aerobic exercise, showed the strongest effects. Study background publication year, study location, and sample size, participant characteristics age and sex, and Main- tenance RE-AIM framework moderated the effects of physical activity on mental health in children and adoles- cents with IDs. Long-term follow-up and degree of sus- taining the intervention are needed in future studies.
