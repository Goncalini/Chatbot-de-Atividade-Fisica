Lacombe et al. BMC Public Health 2019 19:900 Open Access The impact of physical activity and an additional behavioural risk factor on cardiovascular disease, cancer and all-cause mortality: a systematic review Jason Lacombe1 , Miranda E. G. Armstrong2, F. Lucy Wright3 and Charlie Foster2 Abstract Background: Regular physical activity improves overall health, and has the capacity to reduce risk of chronic diseases and death. However, better understanding of the relationship between multiple lifestyle risk behaviours and disease outcomes is pertinent for prioritising public health messaging. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the association between physical inactivity in combination with additional lifestyle risk behaviours smoking, alcohol, diet, or sedentary behaviour for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality. Methods: We searched Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Register from 1 January 2010 to 12 December 2017, for longitudinal observational studies of adults 18+ years in the general population with a publication date of 2010 onwards and no language restriction. Main exposure variables had to include a physical activity measure plus at least one other lifestyle risk factor. In total, 25,639 studies were identified. Titles, abstracts and full-text articles of potentially relevant papers were screened for eligibility. Data was extracted and quality assessment was completed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale NOS. Results: Across the 25 eligible studies, those participants who reported being physically active combined with achieving other health behaviour goals compared to those who were categorised as physically inactive and did not achieve other positive lifestyle goals, were at least half as likely to experience an incident cardiovascular disease CVD event, die from CVD, or die from any cause. These findings were consistent across participant age, sex, and study length of follow-up, and even after excluding lower quality studies. We also observed a similar trend among the few studies which were restricted to cancer outcomes. Most studies did not consider epidemiological challenges that may bias findings, such as residual confounding, reverse causality by pre-existing disease, and measurement error from self-report data. Conclusions: High levels of physical activity in combination with other positive lifestyle choices is associated with better health outcomes. Applying new approaches to studying the complex relationships between multiple behavioural risk factors, including physical activity, should be a priority.

BMC Public Health 2019 19:900 Background An individual’s lifestyle behaviours greatly influence their likelihood of developing and dying of many diseases. In middle to high income countries, physical inactivity, un- healthy eating, smoking, and alcohol consumption, are estimated to contribute to 29% of disease and disability- adjusted life-years lost . According to the World Health Organisation Global Health Risk report, high blood pressure, tobacco use, high blood glucose, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity, high cholesterol, un- safe sex, alcohol use, and low fruit and vegetable intake are the leading risk factors for death in high income countries. Although there are other lifestyle risk factors that have been associated with noncommunicable dis- ease development and death, this review focuses on the most common risk factors which have the biggest effect on disease development and death . These multiple behaviours are also associated with many disease co- morbidities, such as, being overweight or obese, and having high levels of cholesterol, which result in an add- itional 15% elevated risk, and taken together represent a significant public health problem . The independent effects of each of these behaviours on health outcomes are well-established 3–5. There- fore, it may seem reasonable to presume that if an indi- vidual engages in more than one of these unhealthy behaviours, the potential synergistic interaction amongst them should result in poorer health outcomes. However, the research is limited in assessing the co-distribution of these risk factors, and how the patterns of these risk factors have been evolving over time. Historically, the assessment of multiple behavioural risk factors on health outcomes has primarily used co-occurrence methodologies, which evaluate concurrent but inde- pendent engagement in two or more behaviours . In the United Kingdom UK, 70% of the adult popu- lation is estimated to engage in 2 or more of these unhealthy behaviours . Past research has shown that behavioural risk factors are often tackled in policy and clinical contexts as separ- ate issues, to be explored and managed by unique teams and resources . Despite national guidelines and rec- ommendations from the Department of Health , the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Royal College of General Practitioners, choosing physical activity as a clinical priority, and its promotion remains sporadic and undervalued compared to other risk behaviours . Indeed, the impact of screening pro- grammes for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, including modification of behavioural risk fac- tors, appears limited . However, until we can under- stand the independent and also synergistic impacts of changing other risk behaviours with physical inactivity remain the choice of which one to address will uninformed. If this were determined, it would help to in- form clinicians, researchers, and policy decision makers to better explore multiple lifestyle risks with/for their patients, by understanding their impact on multiple co- morbidities and poor health outcomes. Here, we aim to systematically evaluate how the asso- ciation between physical activity in combination with additional lifestyle risk behaviours impacts cardiovascu- lar disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality, and the methods that have been used in previous research to examine the co-distribution of multiple behaviours in adults. Our review is the first global systematic review of adult cohort studies that has examined the associations between physical activity in combination with smoking, alcohol, diet and sedentary behaviour on all-cause mor- tality, and incident cases or mortality from cardiovascu- lar disease or cancer. Methods Search strategy and eligibility criteria We searched Ovid MEDLINE from 1946, EMBASE from 1988 and the Cochrane Central Register between restrictions, for studies in humans to identify research papers estimating the relationship between physical ac- tivity as an exposure variable in combination with one or more other health risk behaviours smoking, alcohol, diet, or sedentary behaviour, on all-cause mortality, and incident cases or mortality from cardiovascular disease or cancer Additional file 3. Across the studies, par- ticipants were classified as active if those participants met the weekly physical activity guidelines in the coun- try that the study took place. Any participant not meet- ing the physical activity guidelines were classified as inactive or categorised into a less healthy category. We only focused on the extreme groups most active group + healthiest profile compared to least active + least healthy profile when co-occurrence methodologies were used. Our search consisted of terms related to physical activity, smoking, diet, sedentary behaviour, and alcohol consumption, and combined these terms with cardiovas- cular disease, cancers, mortality and related terms. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles, and of previous reviews. For a detailed list of all search terms used in each database, refer to Additional file 1. The protocol for this systematic review has been published to the ID: register CRD42017050378 and the abstract has been pre- sented at the International Society of Behavioral Nutri- tion and Physical Activity conference. Reference We included cohort studies of adults 18+ years from the general population with a publication date of 2010 onwards if they investigated associations between phys- least one additional risk factor ical activity and at Lacombe et al. BMC Public Health 2019 19:900 smoking, alcohol, diet, or sedentary behaviour. We only included studies that reported the exclusion of par- ticipants with prevalent disease at baseline. Additionally, a start date of 2010 was chosen to align with the date that the World Health Organisation released the most recent global physical activity guidelines , and stud- ies with a minimum of 8 years of follow-up were in- cluded. We excluded cohorts which were not free-living populations i.e., hospital patient studies, fitness studies, nutritional supplement, and studies which used a certain type of beverage as a measure of nutrition i.e., green tea, protein shake. We excluded populations in which studies were restricted to focus on an occupational group, and thus would not be representative of the lar- ger free-living population i.e., nurse’s, factory workers, students enrolled in a psychology course. We also ex- cluded letters, comments, reviews, meta-analysis, rando- mised control trials, ecological studies, and animal studies. Data extraction and quality assessment Data extraction was conducted with a standard data col- lection form describing the characteristics of each study and the main results Additional file 1. We recorded the following characteristics in the identified studies: au- thor names, name of the paper, cohort name, country, publication year, age at entry, sex, sample size of cohort, confirmation of eligibility criteria y/n, method used to group lifestyle behaviours, outcomes, duration of follow-up, method of assessment of physical activity, as- certainment of outcomes, adjustment variables in the multivariate model, regression dilution correction ap- plied y/n, how was handling of missing data completed, and overall main finding. We also extracted information on whether the study had considered bias, residual con- founding, measurement error, and regression dilution. We used hazard ratios or relative risks as a measure of association. The primary exposure variable was physical activity and, as a minimum, one other lifestyle risk fac- tor. Outcomes of interest in this review were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular incidence/mortality, and cancer incidence/mortality. We assessed study quality using a modified Newcastle- Ottawa Scale NOS for cohort studies . The NOS assesses the quality of nonrandomised studies. A point system has been developed in which a study is judged on, the selection of the study groups, the comparability of the groups, and the ascertainment of either the expos- ure or outcome of interest for cohort studies. The NOS is recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration as an assessment tool for cohort studies to assess risk of bias. The content validity of the NOS has been established based on a critical examination by several experts. Using NOS for cohort studies, the maximum score a study can receive is 9 points. For this review, we then added add- itional criteria, to assess the strength of the physical ac- tivity measure that was used in more detail, and to explore the control variables that studies used. Using the modified scale, a study could be awarded a maximum of exposure, the question was modified, and studies were given a point if they used either structured interview, or a validated self-report measure. Studies were awarded an additional point bringing the total up to 10 if they con- trolled for age, sex, or a measure of socio-economic sta- tus/education. Data synthesis Overall, studies included in this review were too hetero- geneous in terms of participant characteristics, interven- tion design, and outcome measures to allow for a detailed meta-analysis, thus data was synthesised de- scriptively. Some additional analysis to examine the highest-quality studies in more detail was conducted using the statistical program R version 3.3.3 and a for- est plot was created. To be included in the preliminary analysis Table 1, all studies had to have at minimum 8 years of follow-up and a measure of physical activity with an additional ex- posure variable. Studies also needed to score 8 points or higher on the modified NOS. To take this further, we did more detailed analysis on studies which met these criteria, and additionally used a validated self-report physical activity measure or objective measure. We present all the results in one direction examining the healthiest profile against the least healthy profile. As a result, when necessary the inverse risk ratio has been calculated. In general for all results, the risk ratios are presented and a forest plot was created to visualise the risk relationship between lifestyle behaviour, and dis- ease/death outcomes with the healthiest lifestyle group as the reference compared to the least healthy lifestyle group. We also plotted the 95% Confidence Intervals for each study of interest. For studies which presented risk associations and confidence intervals where the least healthy group was used as the reference, we computed and plotted the inverse risk and confidence intervals. Results Literature search From an initial 25,639 studies retrieved, and following removal of duplicates n = 7621, we screened 18,018 ti- tles. Exclusion by title for all returned results JL, and a 10% double review of titles was completed by 2 inde- pendent assessors JL and MA. This resulted in 4339 abstracts to be reviewed JL and all abstracts were com- pleted JL and CF by two independent assessors. This left 181 full-text articles, which were read in-detail JL, Lacombe et al.

BMC Public Health 2019 19:900 and 84 of these were then excluded because they did not meet inclusion criteria. Data extraction including the characteristics of the samples, methods, and main results was completed for the remaining 97 eligible studies JL. From data extraction, 39 studies did not meet our cri- teria, and were excluded. A total of 58 studies were in- cluded for the final step, which comprised quality assessment completed independently by 2 assessors JL & FLW. For the final analysis, we included only studies which scored at least 8 points or higher out of 10 n = 25. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re- views and Meta-Analyses PRISMA flow diagram is pre- sented showing study inclusion decisions Fig. 1 and a PRISMA checklist is presented in the Additional file 2. Included studies and measures Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 25 studies included. Studies were conducted in the USA n = 6, Sweden n = 6, multiple European countries n = 2, Fig. 1 A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA checklist is presented showing study inclusion decisions Denmark n = 2, United Kingdom n = 3, Italy n = 1, Netherlands n = 1, Korea n = 1, China n = 1, Iran n = 1, and Finland n = 1. The number of participants in each study ranged from 974 to 476,396 . The minimum study length of follow-up was 8.1 years , and the maximum was 21 years . In total, 3 studies used a structured interview to assess physical activity be- haviour 17–19, 8 used a validated self-report question- naire validated questionnaire 14–16, 27–37. No study included an ob- jective measure of physical activity i.e., accelerometry or pedometers. and 14 did not use 19–26, a Outcomes All-cause mortality There was strong evidence that more physical activity and choosing better lifestyle behaviours led to longer survival in all 15 high quality studies examining all- cause mortality. However, the level of risk varied across different combinations of behavioural patterns. All stud- ies found that a high adherence to positive factors in- cluding higher levels of physical activity, not smoking, eating healthy, and limited sedentary behaviour and al- cohol consumption were strongly associated with re- duced risk of all-cause mortality after long-term follow- up, and that this association was even stronger when these positive behaviours were combined 14, 17–19, 21–23, 27–31, 35, 37. For example, Kvaaik and Colleagues 2010 found that after 20-years of follow-up, those in the healthiest cat- egory for all 4 lifestyle behaviours versus those in the least healthy category of lifestyle behaviours had a total mortality risk of 0.29 CI = 0.19–0.43 . Similarly, Prinelli and Colleagues 2015 followed subjects for an average of 17.4 years, and found that those with 1, 2, or death of, 39, 56, and 73% respectively . Petersen and Colleagues 2015 and McCullough and Colleagues 2011 both followed men and women for 14 years on average and found that every additional health recom- mendation adhered to, had a greater protective effect against mortality 31, 35. Comparing lifestyle scores, Fazel-taber Malekshah and colleagues 2016 reported on observations from 40,708 participants, adults in the most healthy group had a significantly reduced risk of morality RR = 0.68; CI = 0.54–0.86 compared to those in the least healthy group . When examining the associations by different sub- groups, McCullough and Colleagues 2011 limited their study to only non-smokers to explore in more detail the impact that following other prevention guidelines be- sides tobacco avoidance has on a cohort . When examining all-cause mortality outcomes by sex, Larsson and Colleagues 2017 found that those with all four Lacombe et al. BMC Public Health 2019 19:900 positive health behaviours compared to 0 had a reduced risk for men RR = 0.47; CI = 0.44–0.51 and women RR = 0.39; CI = 0.35–0.44 . Similarly, Yun and col- leagues 2012 found men and women with 4 healthy lifestyle factor points including high levels of physical ac- tivity compared to no healthy lifestyle factor points and no physical activity reported had a 0.50 0.23–1.08 . Behrens and Colleagues 2013 included a measure of adiposity in their lifestyle score and found that these re- sults held, even with an additional measure . Physical activity significantly reduced risk of mortality independ- ently RR = 0.86; CI = 0.84–0.89 with the larger the number of positive behaviours adhered to, the lower the risk, estimating that 33% of deaths were prevented if subjects adhered to all positive health behaviours. Exam- ining the dual-associations between physical activity dur- ation and history of smoking, O’Donovan and colleagues 2017 found those who exercised for over 60 min/week and were never smokers had a significantly reduced mortality risk compared to those who did no exercise and were current smokers, RR = 0.29; CI = 0.24–0.36 . Cardiovascular disease A total of 14 high quality studies included a CVD out- come. This included 10 which examined CVD broadly 15, 16, 18, 21, 30, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 1 stroke incidence , 1 myocardial infarction , and 2 heart failure 24, 34. Similar to the all-cause mortality findings, there was evidence that engaging in regular physical activity, and additional healthy behaviours was associated with a reduced risk for developing and dying of cardiovascular outcomes, and these finding were consistent across gen- der, age, and populations sampled. After 21 years of follow-up in a sample of 2096 participants, Eriksen and Colleagues 2015 found that the population attributable fraction for Coronary Heart Disease CHD and CVD amongst both Europeans n = 1090 and South Asians n = 1006 was 43% for CHD and 28% for CVD in Euro- peans and 63% for CHD and 51% for CVD in South Asians who did not have any of the four healthy behav- iours surveyed at baseline . Kvaanik and others 2010 looked at the influence of lifestyle on CVD over for CVD was 30%, and compared to those who did no physical activity and had the least healthy profile, indi- viduals in the healthiest category had the greatest re- duced risk 0.32 CI = 0.15–0.69 In 40,708 participants comparing lifestyle scores over an 8-year follow-up period, those in the healthy group had a sig- nificantly reduced risk of CVD mortality RR = 0.53, CI = 0.37–0.77 compared to those in the unhealthy group . Hulsegge and Colleagues 2016 found that inde- pendent of baseline lifestyle behaviour reporting when . re-measured later, each decrement in lifestyle factors was associated with a 35% higher risk of CVD, and indi- viduals who maintained their healthy lifestyle over time 4 to 5 factors had 2.5 times lower risk of CVD HR = 0.43, CI = 0.25–0.63 compared to those who maintained an unhealthy lifestyle profile 0 to 1 factors . 2015 found a significant Examining various sub-groups, Petersen and Col- risk reduction leagues amongst those men and women who achieved all five lifestyle behaviour points compared to those who did not . For CVD mortality, the adjusted hazard ratio for those in the category of 4–5 positive lifestyle behav- iours compared to those with 0 was 0.20 CI = 0.14– 0.0.29 for men and 0.21 CI = 0.11–0.41 for women. In a population-based cohort of 60-year-old men n = 2039 and women n = 2193 after 11 years of follow-up, for those categorised as very healthy compared to unhealthy, the respective hazard ratios were 0.25 CI = 0.15–0.44 for men and 0.35 CI = 0.23–0.54 for women . Examining men only we excluded women because one of the scoring criteria included breastfeeding, Vergnaud and others 2013 found that after 12.8 years, men in the healthiest category compared to the least healthy cat- egory RR = 0.64, CI = 0.50–0.82 were less likely to die of CVD . Moreover, the largest study cohort n = 111,966 found that achieving more recommended be- haviours categorized as healthy compared to least healthy had a reduced risk of CVD mortality in both men RR = 0.52, CI = 0.45–0.59 and women RR = 0.42, CI = 0.35–0.51 over 14 years of follow-up . When examining the dual-association between seden- tary behaviour, specifically sitting time, and physical ac- tivity in women, Chomistek and Colleagues 2013 found a non-statistically significant interaction between sitting time and physical activity with CVD pinteraction = 0.94 . Similarly, O’Donovan and Colleagues 2017 examined the dual-associations between physical activity and smoking behaviour in 106,341 participants and found that after 9.4 years, those who were regular exer- cisers of over 60 min a week and did not smoke had a reduced risk of CVD mortality RR = 0.27, CI = 0.18– 0.42 compared to those who did not exercise and were current smokers . Similar results were evident for heart failure when examining men and women separately . Wang and Colleagues 2011 examined 18,346 men and 19,729 women and followed them for a median of 14.1 years. They found that for both men and women, having a healthier lifestyle profile resulted in a reduced risk of heart failure . Having all 4 lifestyle factors compared to none, resulted in a hazard ratio of 0.31 CI = 0.17– 0.56 for men and, 0.19 CI = 0.09–0.40 for women. In a sample of 33,966 men and 30,713 women followed for the relative risks for heart disease in the Lacombe et al. BMC Public Health 2019 19:900 healthiest lifestyle profile compared to the least healthy profile, which included those with 0 healthy lifestyle risk factors, was 0.38 0.28–0.53 in men and 0.28 0.19– 0.41 in women . For stroke, it was found that com- pared to the least healthy lifestyle profile no lifestyle points, those with the healthiest profile 5 lifestyle points had a relative risk of 0.38 CI = 0.20–0.73 . Finally, examining incident myocardial infarction in 20, style points compared to none gave a relative risk of 0.14 CI = 0.04–0.43, and these researchers concluded that this combination of positive behaviours could have prevented 79% CI = 0.34–0.93% of the events in this study cohort . Cancers A total of 12 studies assessed cancer as an outcome. Eight studies focused on cancer broadly 15–17, 21, 27, 31, 35, 37. Three studies examined colorectal cancer 20, 26, 39, and one study examined breast cancer . In general, engaging in a higher number of healthy be- haviours compared to less, led to greater protection against most cancers. Kabat and Colleagues 2015 followed 476,396 participants for 10.5 years on average, during which time, 73,784 people had a first incident cancer diagnoses and 16,193 people died of cancer . Similarly, in 40,708 participants after 8-years of follow- up, those in the healthy group compared to the least healthy group had a reduced risk of cancer mortality RR = 0.82, CI = 0.53–0.86 . Moreover, Kaavik and colleagues followed UK adults for 20 years where 18 deaths of 4886 deaths were attributed to cancer and they found that those participants with all positive health be- haviours and those taking more physical activity versus those with no positive health behaviours and reporting no physical activity had a hazard ratio of 0.29 CI = 0.15–0.60 . Looking at subgroups, McCullough and others 2011 examined 111,966 non-smoking men and women and the relative risk for those in the healthiest category of lifestyle behaviour 7–8 versus those in the least healthy category 0–2 and found that risk was 0.70 CI = 0.61– 0.80 for men and 0.76 CI = 0.65–0.89 for women . This was similar to Vergnaud and Colleagues 2013 where men’s adjusted risk was 0.86 CI = 0.69–1.07 for cancer after a median of 12.7 years of follow-up . Additionally, after 10.3 years of follow-up of 59,941 Ko- reans, Yun and colleagues found that the risk for cancer mortality was 0.42 CI = 0.35–0.69 in men and 0.50 0.23–1.08 in women . Petersen and colleagues 2015 explored cancer mortality risk in Danish men and women over a 14-year period and found that adherence to 4–5 positive lifestyle behaviours versus 0 positive life- style behaviours gave an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.33 0.26–0.42 for cancer mortality in men and 0.41 0.29– 0.58 in women . Lastly, O’Donovan and Colleagues 2017 examined the dual-associations between physical activity and smoking behaviour and found that regular exercisers who did not smoke had a greater reduced risk of cancer mortality RR = 0.30, CI = 0.22–0.41 compared to those who never exercised and were current smokers . Three cohort studies examined colorectal cancer spe- cifically. In a sample of 59,503 men followed for 9.28 years, Zhang and Colleagues 2017 found that each in- crement in score in having a healthier lifestyle was asso- ciated with a 17% reduced risk of colorectal cancer HR = 0.83; CI = 0.78–0.89, 27% for rectal cancer HR = 0.73; CI = 0.66–0.82, and 10% for colon cancer HR = 0.90; CI = 0.83–0.99 . Kirkegaard and Colleagues 2010 found that higher physical activity levels and choosing more positive lifestyle behaviours was associ- ated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in a sample of 55,487 men and women, incidence rate ratio 0.89 CI = 0.82–0.96 . However, Nomura and Colleagues 2016 when examining incidence in African American women, found that adherence to more positive behav- iours were not associated with colorectal cancer risk . Lastly, the one cohort study examining breast can- cer risk in postmenopausal women n = 242,912 found that having a higher score of healthier behaviours score of 4 compared to 1 reduced the risk of breast cancer in- cidence after a median of 10.9 years of follow-up ad- justed hazard ratio = 0.74, CI = 0.66–0.83 . High quality studies When we included more stringent criteria, restricting to studies with 8+ years of follow-up, and the use of a structured interview or a validated physical activity measure, we had 11 remaining studies Table 2.

Overall, greater number of positive health behaviours resulted in reduced risk of death, and being less likely to develop and die of cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. Figure 2 examines the risk relationship between those in each cohort that were categorised as the healthiest reference group compared to those in the least healthy category. The results and evidence are quite strong that less healthy lifestyle behaviour puts one at a higher risk of death and cardiovascular disease incidence or mortal- ity.

Discussion Overall, we aimed to examine the association between how higher levels of physical activity in combination with additional positive lifestyle behaviours impacts car- diovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality. Across the 25 eligible studies, those participants who re- ported higher levels of physical activity combined with achieving other health behaviour goals compared to those who were categorised as physically inactive and did not achieve other positive lifestyle goals, were at least half as likely to experience an incident CVD event, die from CVD, or die from any cause. These findings were consistent across participant age, sex, and study length of follow-up, and even after excluding lower qual- ity studies. We observed a similar trend among the few studies which were restricted to cancer outcomes. Al- though limited, evidence from high quality cohorts sug- gests that the categorisation of multiple lifestyle risks groups, and thus the group someone is categorised into, is strongly predictive of long-term mortality and cardio- vascular and cancer morbidity. To date, there have been few high-quality studies examining combined effects of physical activity and life- style risk factors on cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and mortality risk. We found that most studies were limited by bias attributable to residual confounding, reverse causality by pre-existing disease, and measurement error with self-report data. In most prospective studies exam- ined, physical activity assessed at baseline was used to investigate the association of activity with health out- comes many years later. As a result, these studies do not accurately characterise activity during long periods of follow-up, since measurement error could occur at the time of assessment, and physical activity behaviours may change over time 40, 41. Moreover, while measurement error may be less of a concern for other behavioural risk factors except diet, changes over time are still com- mon, and these errors may result in regression dilution bias. Regression dilution bias in these studies could have resulted in the attenuation in the estimates of the risk associations between behavioural risk factors assessed at baseline and the health outcome of interest . Resur- veys on a representative sample of study participants can be used to correct for regression dilution , and allow behavioural risk factor information to more accurately reflect the “usual” exposure levels over the follow-up period . Additionally, we found that across studies, reporting of physical activity has been heterogeneous. Physical activity was measured in different contexts and envi- ronments, and generally included different scores for intensity, duration measurements through self-report. Without standardised agreement across publications, readers face several challenges in determining the implications and impact of the asso- ciations between lifestyle risk factors and disease out- comes . frequency and Lacombe et al. BMC Public Health 2019 19:900 Fig. 2 Forest plot of risk comparing those who were categorised as healthiest compared to those who were categorised as least healthy All studies included in this review assessed multiple behavioural risk factors using co-occurrence methodolo- gies. These methods have limitations as they require lifestyle behaviours into ‘risky/un- dichotomisation of healthy’ versus ‘not risky/healthy’ , and thereby limit conclusions that can be made on a dose response. In addition, co-occurrence methodologies provide no indi- cation of whether the co-occurrence of behaviours is, in part or in whole, the result of the association between the behaviours . Future research needs to explore the use of new analysis approaches, such as cluster analysis, to examine the association of multiple behavioural risk factors on health outcomes. For example, cluster analysis is not restricted to dichotomous behaviour categorisa- tion, and allows the identification of association patterns using multiple levels for each variable, thereby providing answers on dose response . Our findings suggest that health researchers, policy makers, and clinicians need to shift their focus from the independent effects to the combined effects of lifestyle behaviours on disease outcomes. Further investment in high quality research addressing this objective is war- ranted. Traditionally, the UK Department of Health has not adopted a holistic approach to preventive medicine , perhaps because policies on lifestyle risk factors have been separated into individual risks. The resulting focus has been on independent risk factors and their impact on diseases, rather than how multiple lifestyle risk fac- tors are jointly distributed across the population, and how these impact disease outcomes . Limitations Despite our rigorous title and abstract screening proto- col, search terms for physical activity may have been omitted from the title and abstract and thus gone un- detected. This is possible because, if a study focused pre- dominately on smoking and alcohol, although physical activity could have been included in the full-text, it may not have been mentioned at the abstract level because this exposure was not one of the main exposures of Lacombe et al. BMC Public Health 2019 19:900 interest. Additionally, each observational study adjusted by using different covariates, measuring exposures differ- ently, and had different follow-up times. This may have led to the high heterogeneity observed in our review, thereby limiting our ability to conduct a meta-analysis. Given the many differences in how each study cate- gorised and measured lifestyle behaviours, as well as, the differences in the number of behaviours included in each study, we were unable to compute an I2 statistic which would have provided a useful measure of the variation across these studies rather than that of chance. Across all studies, physical activity was measured by using self-report or structured interviews. Therefore, re- call bias within the reviewed results must be considered. We performed detailed data extraction of all included studies, and completed the NOS to assess study quality. Future work should apply more sophisticated and ob- jective physical activity measurement methods. Also, there was little consistency across studies regarding how the frequency, intensity and duration of physical activity were recorded. Limiting this review to observational re- search, which in many cases only reported physical ac- tivity at baseline, allowed for conclusions to only consider physical activity during the time of examin- ation. The re-measurement or continuous monitoring of physical activity levels between exposure measurement and outcome occurrence would allow for more accurate conclusions, and should be a focus of future work. Conclusions In summary, this was the first global systematic review of adults to examine the combined effect of physical ac- tivity with other positive lifestyle behaviours and its rela- tionship with cardiovascular disease, and mortality from any cause. High levels of physical activity when combined with other positive lifestyle choices are associated with better health outcomes. Physical activity is only one part of multifaceted lifestyle behaviours, and applying new approaches to studying the complex rela- tionships between multiple behavioural risk factors, in- cluding physical activity should be a priority. cancer, Additional files Additional file 1: Physical activity + risk factors and incidence and mortality of non-communicable diseases.
