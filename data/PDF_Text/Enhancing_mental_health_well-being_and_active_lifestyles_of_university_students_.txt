Depression is also the major contributor to suicide in 2015. Nearly that number again suffers from a deaths, which number close to 800 000 per year. Frequently asked questions 1. What are common mental disorders? What is depression? Common mental disorders refer to two main diagnostic categories: depressive disorders and anxiety disorders. These disorders are highly prevalent in the population hence why they are considered ‘common’, and impact on the mood or feelings of affected persons; symptoms range in terms of their severity from mild to severe and duration from months to years. These disorders are diagnosable health conditions, and are distinct from feelings of sadness, stress or fear that anyone can experience from time to time in their lives. 2. How many people are affected by depression? At a global level, over 300 million people are estimated to suffer from depression, equivalent to 4.4% of the world’s population. 3. Is the number of people with common mental disorders increasing? The number of persons with common mental disorders globally is going up, particularly in lower-income countries, because the population is growing and more people are living to the age when depression and anxiety most commonly occurs. 4. Who is most likely to get depressed? Although depression can and does affect people of all ages, from all walks of life, the risk of becoming depressed is increased by poverty, unemployment, life events such as the death of a loved one or a relationship break-up, physical illness and problems caused by alcohol and drug use.

Data sources Syntheses of the available epidemiological In order to provide the most up-to-date information literature on the prevalence of depression and on the number of people with common mental other common mental disorders have been disorders, WHO has worked with the lead GBD undertaken as part of earlier iterations of the researchers for mental and behavioural disorders Global Burden of Disease GBD study, including based at the School of Public Health, University of reviews published for the 2000 and 2010 editions Queensland, Australia to produce – and present 1-4.

Country-specific estimates of disease prevalence for the year 2015, which are shown in the Appendix, can also be accessed via a GBD Results Tool made available by the Institute of Health Metrics and lost and years lived with disability by cause. Evaluation Seattle, USA at: Definitions Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self- worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of tiredness, and poor concentration. Depression can be long- lasting or recurrent, substantially impairing an individual’s ability to function at work or school or cope with daily life. At its most severe, depression can lead to suicide. Depressive disorders include two main sub-categories: major depressive disorder / depressive episode, which involves symptoms such as depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and decreased energy; depending on the number and severity of symptoms, a depressive episode can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe; and dysthymia, a persistent or chronic form of mild depression; the symptoms of dysthymia are similar to depressive episode, but tend to be less intense and last longer. A further important distinction concerns depression in people with or without a history of manic episodes. Bipolar affective disorder typically consists of both manic and depressive episodes separated by periods of normal mood. Manic episodes involve elevated mood and increased energy, resulting in over-activity, pressure of speech and decreased need for sleep. Bipolar affective disorder is not included in the data below. Anxiety disorders refer to a group of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, including generalised anxiety disorder GAD, panic disorder, phobias, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder OCD and post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD. As with depression, symptoms can range from mild to severe. The duration of symptoms typically experienced by people with anxiety disorders makes it more a chronic than episodic disorder. DEPRESSION AND OTHER COMMON MENTAL DISORDERS: GLOBAL HEALTH ESTIMATES Global and regional estimates of prevalence Depression The proportion of the global population with depression in 2015 is estimated to be 4.4%. The total number of people living with depression in the world is 322 million. Nearly Upper and lower uncertainty intervals are half of these people live in the South-East Asia represented in the bar graph by the error Region and Western Pacific Region, reflecting bars. Depression is more common among the relatively larger populations of those two females 5.1% than males 3.6%. Regions which include India and China, for example. The total estimated number of people living with depression increased by 18.4% between growth of the global population, as well as a proportionate increase in the age groups at which depression is more prevalent. Prevalence varies by WHO Region, from a low of 2.6% among males in the Western Pacific Region to 5.9% among females in the African Region. Country-specific estimates can be accessed at results-tool. Prevalence rates vary by age, peaking in older adulthood above 7.5% among females aged 55-74 years, and above 5.5% among males. Depression also occurs in children and adolescents below the age of 15 years, but at a lower level than older age groups.
