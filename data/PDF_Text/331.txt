Rainey-Smith2,3,4,5, James Doecke6,7, Shaun Markovic1,2, Abstract Background: Physical inactivity has been consistently linked to increased risk of cognitive decline; however, studies examining the impact of exercise interventions on cognition have produced inconsistent findings. Some observational studies suggest exercise intensity may be important for inducing cognitive improvements; however, this has yet to be thoroughly examined in older adult cohorts. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of systematically manipulated high-intensity and moderate-intensity exercise interventions on cognition. Methods: This multi-arm pilot randomised clinical trial investigated the effects of 6 months of high-intensity exercise and moderate-intensity exercise, compared with an inactive control, on cognition. Outcome measures were assessed at pre- baseline, post- 6 months, and 12 months post-intervention. Ninety-nine cognitively normal men and women aged 60–80 years were enrolled from October 2016 to November 2017. Participants that were allocated to an exercise group i.e. high- intensity or moderate-intensity engaged in cycle-based exercise two times per week for 6 months. Cognition was assessed using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Cardiorespiratory fitness was evaluated by a graded exercise test. Results: There was a dose-dependent effect of exercise intensity on cardiorespiratory fitness, whereby the high-intensity group experienced greater increases in fitness than the moderate-intensity and control groups. However, there was no direct effect of exercise on cognition. Conclusions: We did not observe a direct effect of exercise on cognition. Future work in this field should be appropriately designed and powered to examine factors that may contribute to individual variability in response to intervention.

Brown et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy 2021 13:33 inactivity is considered one of Introduction Physical the greatest modifiable risk factors for dementia ; however, at- tempts to provide definitive evidence from randomised controlled trials RCTs of a link between exercise and enhanced cognition have been inconsistent. Indeed, a insufficient evidence, in cognitively normal older adults, to suggest an effect of exercise on cognition. While a more recent meta-analysis , assessing a similar cohort, identified positive effects of exercise when session dura- tions were in excess of 45 min and at least of moderate intensity. These conflicting results indicate the need for greater clarity for the use of exercise as a method for preventing cognitive decline, specifically the precise pa- rameters needed for improving brain health. When compared with the total volume of physical ac- tivity, observational work has reported a stronger associ- ation between objectively measured intensity of physical activity and cognitive function 4, 5. Furthermore, acute bouts of high-intensity exercise improve memory and executive function to a greater extent than moderate- intensity continuous exercise bouts 6, 7. Although pre- vious work in the area is promising, the importance of exericise intensity in enhancing cognitive health requires rigorous examination in RCTs. A recent 12-week inter- vention in older adults demonstrated greater improve- ments in memory after undertaking high-intensity compared with moderate-intensity exercise, or a stretch- ing control . The use of high-intensity exercise is safe in older populations and provides a time-effective method to increase physical health, yet, until more con- sistent and rigorous evidence is available, the widespread use of high-intensity exercise to enhance cognitive health will continue to be questioned. Variability across studies might also be explained by factors moderating exercise-induced changes in cogni- tion. Genetic factors, such as the apolipoprotein E APOE ε4 allele and the brain-derived neurotrophic fac- tor BDNF Val66Met single nucleotide polymorphism, may modulate the relationship between exercise and brain health 10–12. The literature in these fields is pre- dominantly sourced from observational studies, which have contributed to largely inconsistent In addition, variability in cognitive response may be due to variability in cardiorespiratory fitness change following exercise 13, 14. Evidence from RCTs is needed to gain a greater understanding of these potential mediating and moderating effects on cognition. findings. The current pilot RCT was designed to provide a head-to-head comparison of work-matched moderate- intensity and high-intensity exercise on cognition in cog- nitively normal older adults. We hypothesised that both intervention groups would receive benefits to cognition, but the high-intensity group would receive additional benefit beyond the moderate-intensity group in a dose- dependent fashion. Based on the hypothesis that in- creases in cardiorespiratory fitness are an important fac- tor in the relationship between exercise and cognition, we investigated whether change in fitness is associated with improved cognition. Finally, we conducted an ex- ploratory investigation as to whether targeted genetic factors APOE ε4 carriage and BDNF Val66Met moder- ate the effect of exercise on cognition, and the relation- ship between altered fitness and cognitive changes. Based on previous literature, we hypothesised that APOE ε4 carriers and BDNF Val66Met carriers would receive the greatest benefit from exercise, in terms of cognitive improvements 10, 12. Methods Trial design The Intense Physical Activity and Cognition IPAC study was a single-site parallel pilot randomised con- trolled trial conducted between October 2016 and Sep- tember 2019 at Murdoch University and the Australian Alzheimer’s Research Foundation, Western Australia. An open access protocol paper for the IPAC study has been published previously . Participants were rando- mised to either 6 months of supervised high-intensity exercise, supervised moderate-intensity exercise, or an inactive control group. Reporting of this study adheres to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials CON- SORT guidelines . The IPAC study is registered with the Australian New Zea- land Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12617000643370. The human research ethics committees at Murdoch University and Edith Cowan University approved the conduct of this study, and all participants provided written informed consent. Participants and randomisation Participants were recruited between October 2016 and including November 2017 from a number of sources, media advertisement, flyers, and word-of-mouth. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria have been de- scribed previously . Our power analysis was based on the primary outcome of cognitive function: using data from Vidoni et al. , we required 28 participants per group to detect differences between three groups at 80% power and the 5% level of significance. A block ran- domisation protocol conducted by a researcher who was not collecting outcome data was used to randomly assign participants to one of the following three groups: high-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise, or a control group. Brown et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy 2021 13:33 Interventions Participants that were allocated to an exercise group i.e. high-intensity or moderate-intensity engaged in exercise two times per week under the supervision of an Accre- dited Exercise Physiologist for 6 months. Each exercise session lasted 50 min and was conducted on a cycle erg- ometer Wattbike Pro; Wattbike, Australia. Target in- tensity was set using the 6 to 20 Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion . Further details of the exercise interven- tions can be found within the supplementary material. Adherence to the intervention was measured via ses- sion attendance. In addition, exercise intensity was cal- culated for each participant in the moderate- and high- intensity groups: the percentage of peak aerobic power measured via a graded exercise test was calculated for each session not including the warm-up, cool-down, and for the high-intensity group, the recovery between intervals. The percentage of peak aerobic power in the initial 3 months were calculated using baseline peak aer- obic power output, while months 4 to 6 were calculated from the mid- using peak aerobic power output intervention fitness test. Participants randomised to the control group were provided with an information session regarding the ben- efits of exercise for overall physical health and known benefits to the brain. Participants in the control group did not receive any exercise instructions. Procedures and outcome measures Full methodological detail regarding outcome measures can be found in the supplementary material. Cognitive assessment A comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to all participants at baseline, 6 months, and tion, attention, episodic memory, and executive function were calculated. MoCA, Wechsler Adult The battery included the Montreal Cognitive Assess- ment Intelligence Scale-III Digit Span, California Verbal Learning Test CVLT-II, Brief Visual Memory Test BVMT, Trail Making Test forms A and B, and the NIH EXAMINER Verbal fluency task, Flanker, and Set-shifting. A computerised Cogstate battery www.cogstate.com was administered including Groton Maze learning and recall, and identification, de- tection, one-card learning, and one-back tasks. We calculated cognitive composite scores using z- scores of individual’s performances across all timepoints. For scores where a lower score indicates better perform- ance i.e. speed, we inversed the score score-1. The composite scores included the following tasks: 1 Global cognitive composite: Digit Span, Cogstate one-back, Cogstate identification task, CVLT learning, short delay recall, long delay recall, and recognition d`, BVMT learning and long delay recall, Cogstate Groton Maze recall, Trails B, Phonemic fluency, Flanker, and Set- shifting; 2 Attention: Digit Span Forward only and Cogstate identification task; 3 Episodic Memory: CVLT short delay recall, long delay recall, and recognition d`, BVMT long delay recall, and Groton Maze recall; and 4 Executive function: Trails B, Phonemic fluency, Flanker, and Set-shifting. Physical assessment At baseline, 3, 6, and 18 months, all participants under- went a cycling-based graded exercise test to quantify peak aerobic capacity VO2peak and peak power. All participants also underwent a dual-energy X-ray absorp- tiometry DXA scan, using a Hologic Discovery Bone Densitometer Hologic, USA, in order to quantify vol- ume of fat, muscle, and bone tissue in the body. Genotyping TaqMan genotyping assays were performed to deter- mine APOE genotype rs7412, assay ID: C90497310; rs429358, assay ID: C308479320 and BDNF Val66- Met single nucleotide polymorphism rs6265, assay ID: indicating C1159275810. Dichotomous APOE ε4 carriers or non-carriers and BDNF Val66Met carriers or non-carriers were created. variables Statistical methods Analyses were conducted in R statistical computing packages version 3.6.2 and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 24 IBM. Data were inspected to determine parametric testing was appropri- ate for all physiological and cognitive variables. Descriptive statistics Descriptive statistics were calculated to compare base- line information across study groups. Analyses of vari- ance for continuous variables and chi-square analyses for categorical variables were conducted to identify differences. Intervention group analysis All participants that completed a baseline assessment were included in the intention-to-treat ITT analyses, regardless of adherence to session attendance, or study withdrawal. To examine the effect of study group on cognition over time, a series of linear mixed models LMMs were conducted. Repeated cognitive composite scores were entered as dependent variables, and age, gender, education, time years, group, and timegroup were entered as fixed factors, and participant identifica- tion number as a random factor, into the model. Post any hoc group comparisons were conducted for Brown et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy 2021 13:33 significant timegroup interactions high-intensity as ref- erence group. LMMs were conducted for baseline and 6-month data only, and then again for baseline, 6-, and 18-month data. We report raw mean change scores from baseline and 95% confidence intervals, and unstandard- ized beta coefficients B and their standard error. A positive B represents a positive slope for the moderate/ high-intensity groups, compared with the control group. We ran LMMs to investigate the moderating effects of BDNF Val66Met and APOE ε4 carriage on cognitive per- formance over the intervention. Each LMM had an add- itional interaction of either BDNFtimegroup or APOE timegroup entered into separate models. Individual variability analysis The relationships between change in cognition and change in cardiorespiratory fitness VO2peak from pre- to post-intervention within the high-intensity group only, and for all study participants, were examined. Residualised change scores were generated by entering post-intervention score as the dependent variable and pre-intervention score as the independent variable. Lin- ear models were run with the residualised cognitive change as the dependent variable and residualised fitness change as the independent variable age, gender, and education as covariates . For all study participants, the linear models were re-run with the inclusion of ei- ther BDNFfitness change or APOEfitness change. The cohort was then stratified by BDNF Val66Met carriage or APOE ε4 carriage and the linear models re-run. Results One hundred and eight participants were enrolled, with ninety-nine completing all baseline assessments and sub- sequent randomisation to a study group Fig. 1; descrip- tive data, Table 1. Seven participants withdrew during the 6-month intervention. Fig. 1 CONSORT diagram for Intense Physical Activity and Cognition study Brown et al.

The high-intensity group maintained 120.6 ± 25.1% of peak aerobic power during the high-intensity intervals, while the moderate-intensity group cycled continuously at 70.1 ± 16.3% of peak aerobic power. There were no serious adverse events recorded. Group comparisons A timegroup effect was observed for cardiorespiratory fit- ness, peak aerobic power, and body fat from pre- to post- intervention Table 2. The high-intensity group experienced greater improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness + 24.3% compared with the moderate-intensity group + 12.4%; B = 3.92, p 0.01, and control group + 2.4%; B = 7.36, p 0.001. The high-intensity group also experienced greater im- provements in peak aerobic power + 29%; B = 55.62, p 0.001 and decreases in percentage body fat − 3.5%; B = − 1.59, p 0.05, compared with the control group peak power change, + 1.3%; percentage body fat change, 0.0%. There were no significant timegroup effects on any of the cognitive composite scores. Main effects for time were significant for the executive function composite variable p 0.05, likely indicating a small practice effect experienced on the tasks assessing this cognitive domain. Similarly, there were no significant effects of the genoty- petimegroup interactions on the cognitive composite scores. Individual variability analysis Within the high-intensity group only, changes in cardiore- spiratory fitness were associated with changes in global cognitive function F = 4.91, p 0.05, ηp 2 = 0.18 and ex- ecutive function F = 13.89, p 0.001, ηp 2 = 0.37; Table 3. Increases in cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with improvements in global cognition F = 4.37, p 0.05, ηp 2 = 0.06 and executive function F = 4.83, p 0.05, ηp 2 = 0.06 from pre- to post-intervention in the whole sample. The BDNFfitness change interaction term was signifi- cant for global cognition F = 5.13, p 0.05, ηp 2 = 0.07, executive function F = 4.54, p 0.05, ηp 2 = 0.06, and episodic memory F = 4.96, p 0.05, ηp 2 = 0.07. Post hoc analyses of these interactions revealed non-Met carriers i.e. BDNF Val/Val homozygotes received benefit in terms of a relationship between change in cardiorespira- tory fitness and global cognitive function F = 7.52, p 0.01, ηp 2 = 0.16 and executive function F = 8.83, p 0.01, ηp 2 = 0.18; Fig. 2a–c, i.e. greater improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with greater im- provements in cognitive performance post-intervention among non-Met carriers.

Abbreviations: BDNF Val66Met, brain-derived neurotrophic factor Valine66Methionine single nucleotide polymorphism; VO2peak, peak aerobic capacity fitness measurement fitness, compared with the moderate-intensity group. We did not observe any beneficial effects to cognition when comparing group performance from pre- to post- intervention. However, changes in cardiorespiratory fit- ness from pre- to post-intervention were associated with changes in global cognition and executive function in the high-intensity group, and the entire cohort. From explora- tory genetic analyses, we observed moderating effects of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, whereby the relation- ship between change in cognition and change in fitness was only evident in Val/Val homozygotes i.e. non-Met carriers. When examining the group-level data, we found no ef- fect of either the high- or moderate-intensity exercise in- terventions on cognitive performance. These findings are inconsistent with a recent RCT which demonstrated improvements on a single high-interference memory task, following a 12-week high-intensity exercise inter- vention, compared to moderate-intensity exercise . As the cohort within the current study and that investigated by Kovacevic et al. were similar for age, cognitive status, and health, a methodological difference between studies may instead account for the disparate findings. It is pos- sible that more frequent exercise, at least thrice-weekly delivered by Kovacevic and colleagues, is required to induce cognitive benefit, even with a shorter interven- tion period 12 weeks. Indeed, the induction of neuro- trophic factors e.g. BDNF may be required on a more ‘frequent’ basis to contribute to detectable neural bene- fits . It would not be surprising that duration and frequency, in addition to intensity, play an important role in exercise-induced cognitive response. Thus, future studies are required to further elucidate the optimal ex- ercise parameters for benefiting cognition. Within the entire cohort, and high-intensity group alone, changes in cardiorespiratory fitness were associ- ated with changes in global cognitive performance and executive function from pre- to post-intervention, with moderate to high effect sizes observed. These data sup- port prior work that has reported relationships between exercise-induced improvements in cardiorespiratory fit- ness and cognitive changes 13, 20, 22, 23. The high- intensity exercise intervention in the current study in- creased cardiorespiratory fitness levels greater than prior similar RCTs in older adults typically 10–15% increases 8, 13, 24. It therefore remains puzzling as to why the observed associations between changes in cardiorespira- tory fitness and cognition did not yield group-level dif- ferences in cognitive outcomes. While it is possible that individuals with the poorest baseline cognition and fit- ness levels were more likely to experience fitness- associated cognitive improvement irrespective of exer- cise intervention, our statistical analysis at least partially corrected for this potential bias. It is also important to consider whether the cognitive assessments used within this generally high-functioning sample were sensitive enough to detect differences between groups. We conducted an exploratory analysis to examine whether important genetic factors play a role in deter- mining cognitive response following the delivered exer- cise intervention, and it is important to note that these analyses may have been underpowered. The associations between changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and global cognition, executive function, and episodic memory were strongest in BDNF Val/Val homozygotes. Increases in BDNF levels are one of the most well-supported mech- anistic theories underlying the relationship between ex- ercise and brain health . BDNF is synthesised in cells as a precursor molecule pro-BDNF, which undergoes proteolytic cleavage to yield the mature form. Carriage of the BDNF Met allele can negatively alter the process- ing of pro-BDNF to mature BDNF in neurons: validation of our preliminary findings by future work would sug- gest that exercise may not be potent enough to counter- this detrimental phenotype. Consistent with our act topic findings, a recent systematic review on this Brown et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy 2021 13:33 revealed Val/Val homozygotes are more likely to gain benefit from exercise in terms of better memory per- formance, compared with Met carriers . Moreover, we also observed a relationship between fitness and glo- bal cognition in APOE ε4 carriers, but not non-carriers; however, the interaction term APOEfitness change was not significant indicating that a moderating effect does not exist. It is likely that combinations of genetic factors influence the relationship between cardiorespiratory fit- ness and cognition. Previous studies have detected cu- mulative effects of APOE ε4 carriage and BDNF Val66Met carriage on cognitive decline ; however, our study was not sufficiently powered to examine the APOEBDNF interaction. Consequently, appropriately powered exercise interventions coupled with hypothesis- driven genetic investigation may reveal more on the abil- ity of exercise to either provide added benefit to those with optimal genetic factors, or alternatively counteract detrimental genotypes. Strengths and limitations The lack of an active control group within the current study contributed to differences in exposure e.g. social interactions between our exercise groups and inactive control groups. Nevertheless, as we did not detect group differences across cognitive outcomes, this is unlikely to have affected the results reported here. Our cohort was a generally homogenous sample of highly educated, Cau- casian older adults living in the community, and our re- sults may not be applicable to the wider population. Strengths of the study include the three-group design that aimed to detect intensity differences, and our ability to objectively examine intensity levels throughout the intervention. Indeed, our use of rate of perceived exer- tion to monitor within-subject intensity proved to be an effective method in our older adult cohort, allowing indi- viduals to maintain appropriate intensity targets without the need for frequent testing or the use of monitoring equipment e.g. heart rate monitors. Conclusions We found that in a cohort of cognitively normal older adults, 6 months of supervised high-intensity and moderate-intensity exercise did not directly contribute to improvements in cognition, compared to an inactive control group. Our data did, however, demonstrate that changes in cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with cognitive change from pre- to post-intervention. Fur- thermore, our exploratory analysis of important genetic factors provided preliminary evidence that APOE and BDNF genotypes may affect the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive change. Overall, our data does not provide evidence that high-intensity exercise can contribute to cognitive change in all individuals. Future work in this field should be appropri- ately designed and powered to examine numerous fac- tors that could contribute to individual variability in response to intervention, ultimately leading to individua- lised prescription of exercise to induce cognitive change and ultimately reduce dementia risk.

Percentage of peak power for each month of the intervention for the high-intensity and moderate-intensity exercise groups. Each data point represents a participant’s mean peak power from all attended exercise sessions for that month. A VO2peak test following the third month was used for re-calculation of power. Cor- responding months are different between groups p 0.001; whereby the high-intensity group had higher percentage peak power during all months of the intervention. Abbreviations: M1-6, Month 1 – 6; W, watts. eFigure 2. Linear relationship between change in cardiorespiratory fit- ness residuals and change in global cognition residuals from pre- to immediately post-intervention 6-months in APOE ε4 carriers and non- carriers Abbreviations: APOE, Apolipoprotein E; VO2peak, peak aerobic capacity fitness measurement. eTable 1.
