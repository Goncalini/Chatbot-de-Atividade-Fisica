The efficacy of progressive resistance training programs to concurrently reverse/slow the age-related decline in muscle strength and bone mineral density BMD in older adults remains unclear. Objectives We aimed to quantify concomitant changes in lower-body muscle strength and BMD in older adults following a progressive resistance training program and to determine how these changes are influenced by mode resistance only vs. combined resistance and weight-bearing exercises, frequency, volume, load, and program length. Methods MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase databases were searched for articles published in English before 1 June, 2021. Randomized controlled trials reporting changes in leg press or knee extension one repetition maximum and femur/hip or lumbar spine BMD following progressive resistance training in men and/or women ≥ 65 years of age were included. A random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression determined the effects of resistance training and the individual training characteristics on the percent change ∆% in muscle strength standardized mean difference and BMD mean difference. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool version 2.0 and Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation GRADE criteria. Results Seven hundred and eighty studies were identified and 14 were included. Progressive resistance training increased muscle strength ∆ standardized mean difference = 1.1%; 95% confidence interval 0.73, 1.47; p ≤ 0.001 and femur/hip BMD ∆ mean difference = 2.77%; 95% confidence interval 0.44, 5.10; p = 0.02, but not BMD of the lumbar spine ∆ mean differ- ence = 1.60%; 95% confidence interval − 1.44, 4.63; p = 0.30. The certainty for improvement was greater for muscle strength compared with BMD, evidenced by less heterogeneity I2 = 78.1% vs 98.6% and a higher overall quality of evidence. No training characteristic significantly affected both outcomes p 0.05, although concomitant increases in strength and BMD were favored by higher training frequencies, increases in strength were favored by resistance only and higher volumes, and increases in BMD were favored by combined resistance plus weight-bearing exercises, lower volumes, and higher loads. Conclusions Progressive resistance training programs concomitantly increase lower-limb muscle strength and femur/hip bone mineral density in older adults, with greater certainty for strength improvement. Thus, to maximize the efficacy of progressive resistance training programs to concurrently prevent muscle and bone loss in older adults, it is recommended to incorporate training characteristics more likely to improve BMD.

Unfortunately, aging is associated with the development of many chronic diseases, including sarcope- nia the loss of muscle mass, strength, and function and osteoporosis severe bone loss, which respectively costs the USA $40 billion and $17 billion annually in healthcare. Between the ages of 65 and 80 years, the annual percentage loss in muscle strength is 1–4% for both sexes 5, 6, whereas the decline in bone mineral density BMD is accelerated in women 1–3% vs 0.25–1.5% for men . The reduction in muscle strength and BMD with age decreases the capacity to perform activities of daily living and increases the susceptibility to falls and fractures 7, 8. The factors associated with age-related osteoporosis and sar- copenia are multi-faceted 9, 10 and range from lifestyle e.g., inactivity, nutritional intake 11, 12, psychosocial e.g., self-efficacy, resiliency , and biological factors e.g., genetic, inflammatory, hormonal 14–17. Skeletal muscle and bone are closely interconnected via mechanical and endocrine functions, which are highly sensitive to physical activity 18, 19. During physical activity, external gravitational and inertial and internal skeletal muscle contraction mechanical loads stimu- late dose-dependent changes in bone formation 20–22, S. J. O’Bryan et al. and skeletal muscle releases various growth factors and myokines known to influence muscle protein synthesis and bone turnover rate e.g., insulin-like growth factor-1, inter- leukin-6 . As such, long-term physical exercise train- ing is a cost-effective and non-pharmacological approach to limit the health and economic burden of sarcopenia and osteoporosis in older adults. Previous meta-analyses have reported beneficial effects of progressive resistance training for increasing muscle strength 24–27 and BMD 28–31 in older adults, with complementary benefits such as increased muscle mass 24, 27, improved functional capacity 32, 33, and a reduced fall and fracture risk . However, previous meta-analy- ses have only focused on muscle strength or BMD inde- pendently, with only a recent systematic review reporting a potential benefit of progressive resistance training for improving muscle strength and BMD in older adults with low muscle and bone mass . As such, it remains unclear if progressive resistance training may be used to concomi- tantly reverse/slow the age-related decline in muscle strength and BMD in older adults. Moreover, it remains unknown how dual changes in muscle strength and BMD may be influ- enced by training characteristics such as mode resistance- only training using weighted machines/pulleys and/or free weights vs. combined resistance training and weight-bear- ing/impact-loading exercises such as jumping, agility and/ or balance, frequency sessions per week, volume sets and repetitions, load % one repetition maximum 1RM, and program length total weeks of training. This information may elucidate optimal progressive resistance training guide- lines for the concurrent treatment of sarcopenia and osteo- porosis in older adults, which is of significant clinical value. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of progressive resistance training programs on concomitant changes in lower-body muscle strength and BMD in older adults over the age of 65 years. Furthermore, a sub-group meta-regression aimed to determine how dual changes in muscle strength and BMD are affected by train- ing mode, frequency, volume, load, and program length, so that exercise prescription guidelines for dual benefits could be provided. The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in the Prospero database https:// www. crd. york. ac. uk/ prosp ero/, registration number: 220210 and prepared in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA guide- lines . Eligibility criteria were based on the PICO approach: i male and female participants with a mean age ≥ 65 years; ii randomized controlled trials examining the effect of progres- sive resistance training only or resistance plus weight-bear- ing/impact-loading training of ≥ 4 weeks duration against a non-training prescribed control group; iii changes in BMD for hip, lumbar spine and/or femur no limitations on assess- ment method; and iv changes in muscle strength of the lower limbs assessed via leg press/knee extension 1RM or isometric/isokinetic knee extension strength. Studies were excluded if participants had cancer, were rehabilitating from acute orthopedic surgery within ≤ 6 months, were administered hormone replacement therapy as part of the study intervention, were actively losing weight during the study period, or were judged as having a high risk of bias. Only peer-reviewed journal articles published in English and matching the eligibility criteria were considered for analysis. A literature search in electronic databases PubMed/MED- LINE via EBSCOhost and Embase via Ovid retrieved arti- cles published in English before 1 June, 2021. The reference lists of all included studies were also screened for eligibil- ity. A combination of MeSH/Emtree and free-text terms were included in our Boolean search syntax: geriatrics OR aged OR older adults OR elderly AND resistance training OR resistance exercise OR strength training AND mus- cle strength OR sarcopenia OR muscle mass OR muscle power AND bone mineral density OR osteoporosis OR bone strength OR osteopenia. All records retrieved from the literature search were com- piled into an Endnote library and imported into COVI- DENCE software for screening https:// www. covid ence. org/. Titles and abstracts of potential articles for inclusion were screened against the eligibility criteria by two inde- pendent reviewers SO and CG or MW. When title and abstract screening implied inclusion, the full-text article was then screened by two independent reviewers SO and CG or MW. If it was unclear whether an article met the inclu- sion criteria during the full-text screening process, study authors were contacted for clarification via e-mail. Any disagreements on inclusion were resolved when consensus was reached through discussions with a third reviewer IL. The following information was manually extracted from each individual study included in the analysis and entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet by the first author SO: i full article reference; ii participant characteristics includ- ing sex, age years, body mass kg, height cm, and body mass index BMI kg/m2; iii general training description including exercises performed upper and/or lower body, equipment used resistance machines, free weights, weighted vests, resistance bands, whether training sessions were supervised and training attendance; iv training specifics including mode resistance only or resistance plus weight- bearing/impact-loading, frequency per week, volume sets and repetitions per exercise, load % 1RM, and pro- gram length weeks, and; v pre-exercise and post-exercise intervention mean ± standard deviation SD measures for the primary outcomes including muscle strength leg press 1RM, knee extension 1RM, or maximal isometric/isokinetic knee extension force and BMD femoral neck, total hip, thigh, inter-trochanteric region, trochanter, Ward’s triangle, or lumbar spine; and vi statistical significance for changes in secondary outcomes including body composition, func- tional performance, falls, and self-efficacy. A second reviewer CG validated the extracted data in-person with the first author SO by cross-referencing the spreadsheet against printed hard-copy versions of the included studies. If a study reported multiple outcome meas- ures for muscle strength, leg press 1RM was chosen as the preferred outcome for analysis because of its superior rep- resentation of overall lower-limb muscle strength n = 5; if leg press 1RM was not reported, then maximal isometric/ isokinetic knee extension force was used n = 7. If a study reported BMD for multiple sites on the femur, the femoral neck was chosen as the preferred outcome for analysis as it was the most reported across articles n = 8; if femoral neck BMD was not reported, total hip n = 2 or proximal one-third thigh n = 1 BMD was used. Where standard errors SEs were reported, the SD was calculated using n . The mean changes in muscle the equation SD = SE × strength and BMD were calculated by subtracting the post- intervention mean score from the pre-intervention mean √ Resistance Training for Muscle and Bone Strength in Older Adults S. J. O’Bryan et al. score, whereas the SD of the change was calculated using a correlation coefficient Corr = 0.52 for muscle strength and 0.97 for BMD and the equation: test. When a small study effect was observed, a sensitivity analysis trim-and-fill method was performed. SDchange = SDpre2 + SDpost2 − 2 × Corr × SDpre × SDpost. √ Data were pooled together if there was more than one training intervention group 40–42, if data on male and female individuals were reported separately , if non- exercise groups were supplemented with placebo or vitamin D/calcium 44, 45, and if data were reported for the left and right leg separately . Two assessors SO and MW independently assessed the risk of bias for each outcome measure using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool version 2.0 . Where any differences between assessors were observed, discussions between the authors were conducted to arrive at agreement. In addition to a risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias were assessed using the Grading of Rec- ommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation GRADE approach to evaluate the overall quality of the evidence. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata software version 16.1; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA and RStudio version 1.2.5042, 2020; RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA, USA. Effect size was expressed as Hedges’ g standardized mean difference SMD between interven- tion and control for muscle strength, and as the mean differ- ence MD between intervention and control for BMD. A random-effects multi-variate meta-analysis using restricted maximum likelihood was performed on percent change ∆% in muscle strength and BMD. Because of unknown within- study correlations, Riley’s model was used to estimate an overall correlation between concomitant changes in the out- comes . A univariate meta-analysis was also performed separately for each primary outcome. A random-effects meta-regression was performed using restricted maximum likelihood estimation to determine how muscle strength and BMD were affected by resistance training characteristics mode, frequency, volume, load, and program length and population characteristics when differences were identi- fied between studies. Heterogeneity quantified as I2 meas- ure larger than 60% was considered substantial , and p 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. A small study effect was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger’s A flow diagram of the study selection process is presented in Fig. 1. Overall, 780 studies were identified in the initial database search. Following removal of duplicates n = 350, criteria, and 389 studies were irrelevant. A full-text review of the remaining 41 studies excluded a further 26 studies because of a wrong patient population n = 7, a wrong com- parator n = 8, wrong outcomes n = 7, or a wrong inter- vention n = 4. Fifteen studies were included following a full-text review. Screening of reference lists identified 30 potential articles; however, none of these met the inclusion criteria. Of the 15 included studies, one study was excluded because of a high risk of bias Electronic Supplementary Material ESM. A total of 14 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Several studies appeared to meet the inclusion criteria but were excluded. This included two non-progressive resist- ance training studies 50, 51, two studies that prescribed low-intensity supervised exercise programs to the control group e.g., stretching, walking 52, 53, three studies that prescribed different doses of whey protein to the control and intervention groups 54–56, and one study that reported three repetition maximum strength outcomes . The training and participant characteristics of included stud- ies are detailed in Table 1. A total of 1130 participants across the fourteen studies were included. Of the twelve studies that reported sex 40, 41, 43–46, 58–63, 944/1022 92% were female. The mean age across studies was 70 ± 6.1 years range 65–77 years. Most studies described participants as being apparently healthy, not engaged in regular physical activity, and having no/limited previous resistance train- ing experience, although one study classified participants as being mild to moderately frail and another study only included participants who had experienced a fall in the previous twelve months . Of the nine studies reporting BMI, according to World Health Organization classifica- tion ranges , three included participants with normal BMI 40, 41, 65, five included participants who were over- weight 44, 46, 60–62, and one included participants who Wrong patient population n = 7 Wrong comparator n = 8 Wrong outcomes n = 7 Wrong intervention n = 4 reference lists bias n o i t a c i f i t n e d I i g n n e e r c S y t i l i b g i i l E d e d u l c n I Fig. 1 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA flow diagram of the study selection process were obese . Five studies supplemented participants with varying doses of calcium range 500–1500 mg per day and vitamin D range 200–1000 IU per day 40, 44, 45, 59, 63; in this instance, control and exercise groups were sup- plemented equally 46, 60–62. Training programs were supervised by members of the research team or physical therapists in thirteen stud- ies 40–46, 59–63, 65, whereas one study supervised participants during the initial three months of a twelve- month program . Mean training attendance was 77% range 53–98%. Eight studies 40–43, 58, 61, 62, 65 uti- lized exclusively resistance training-only exercises using weighted/pulley machines and/or free weights i.e., push, pull, five studies 44–46, 59, 63 utilized combined resist- ance training plus weight-bearing/impact-loading exercises such as jumping, agility e.g., change of direction, sideways movements, balance e.g., heel-to-toe, or aerobic e.g., step-ups, squats, stair climbing, and one study com- pared resistance training-only and combined resistance plus weight-bearing/impact-loading programs. Mean program length was 43 ± 17 weeks range 24–84 weeks. Training fre- quency was three sessions per week for nine studies 40–42, 58–63, two sessions per week for four studies 43–46, and one study examined the effect of one vs. two vs. three Resistance Training for Muscle and Bone Strength in Older Adults S.

The green diamonds show the estimated pooled change for each outcome separately, while the blue diamond shows the overall combined effect of the two outcomes. The red ellipse represents the 95% confidence interval of the combined effect, whereas the black ellipse represents the prediction interval for future studies sessions per week . In one study , training frequency was reduced from twice per week to once per week in year two of a two-year program, and hence data after only the first year were examined. Resistance training intensity was a load between 60 and 80% of 1RM for nine studies 43, 45, 58–63, 65, and three studies examined the effect of 40% 1RM 40, 41 or 50% 1RM vs. 80% 1RM. Two studies used elastic resistance bands and, therefore, load could not be quantified 44, 46. The number of completed sets per exercise was three for six studies 43, 44, 58, 60, 61, 65, two for two studies 45, 62, one for two studies 42, 59 and ranged between one and three sets for four studies 40, 41, S. J. O’Bryan et al. 46, 63. Repetitions ranged from six to fifteen per exercise for seven studies 45, 46, 59–63 whereas others completed twelve , ten , or eight repetitions 58, 65; two stud- ies performed seven or fourteen repetitions depending on the load 40, 41. Three studies met the eligibility criteria but did not report both outcome measures in sufficient detail, and information could not be retrieved via e-mail correspondence with study authors 43, 44, 59. As such, these three studies were omit- ted from the meta-analysis. A detailed risk-of-bias analysis is provided in the ESM. Thirteen studies had an overall low risk of bias, one study had some concerns , and one study had a high risk of bias and was excluded from the quantitative analysis. The overall quality of the evidence was high for muscle strength, moderate for femur/hip BMD, and very low for lumbar spine BMD Table 2. and BMD Following Resistance Training Eleven studies 40–42, 45, 46, 58, 60–63, 65 were included in the multi-variate meta-analysis of combined changes in muscle strength control n = 406; intervention n = 498 and femur/hip BMD control n = 402; intervention n = 501.

However, similar positive main effects on muscle strength and femur/hip BMD were observed with higher training fre- quencies, whereas differences in the magnitude and direc- tion of the main effect for muscle strength and femur/hip BMD were observed for mode, volume sets and repetitions, and load. For example, strength improvements were signifi- cantly better following resistance training only Fig. 6a and enhanced with a higher number of sets, whereas improve- ments in femur/hip BMD were enhanced following resist- ance plus weight-bearing/impact-loading training, lower volumes, and higher loads. Program length had a minimal effect on both outcomes. on Concomitant Changes in Muscle Strength and BMD Following Resistance Training From the differences in participant characteristics identi- fied in Sect. 3.2, a sub-group meta-regression determined the effects of age mean age 65–70 years vs. 70 years and BMI normal BMI vs. overweight BMI on strength and BMD outcomes. Age had no significant effect on the positive change in strength or femur/hip BMD following the resistance training intervention both p ≥ 0.05, although the magnitude of the increase tended to be greater for the 65- to 70-year-old group Fig. 3a, b.

Briefly, the following changes were reported for the intervention group compared with the control group: i lean body mass increased for 3/5 studies 62, 63, 65, ii muscle hypertrophy increased for 2/2 studies 41, 43, iii functional performance increased for 10/11 studies 43–46, 59–63, 65, iv number of injuri- ous falls decreased for 1/1 study , and v self-efficacy increased for 2/3 studies 60, 63.

RES resistance training only, RES + WB resistance plus weight-bearing/impact-loading exercises Resistance Training for Muscle and Bone Strength in Older Adults We investigated the effect of progressive resistance train- ing programs on concomitant changes in muscle strength and BMD in older adults and report that: i progressive resistance training concomitantly increased muscle strength and femur/hip BMD, but not lumbar spine BMD, ii larger heterogeneity and uncertainty for positive adaptation was reported for femur/hip BMD over muscle strength, iii the strongest determinant for concomitant increases in muscle strength and femur/hip BMD was a higher training fre- quency, and iv opposite main effects on muscle strength and femur/hip BMD were observed for resistance training mode, load, and volume. and Concomitant Changes in Muscle Strength and BMD The loss of muscle and bone is an inevitable part of the aging process. As such, effective interventions that can miti- gate both muscle and bone loss have an important clinical relevance. We report that progressive resistance training improved muscle strength in 13/14 studies ∆ SMD = 1.12% or MD 25.06% when measured via leg press 1RM 40–45, 58–63, 65, while femur/hip BMD was improved in 6/12 studies ∆ MD = 2.77% 42, 46, 59, 61–63. The magnitude of the increase is clinically relevant considering the positive association between muscle strength and functional capacity and the inverse relationship between BMD and fracture risk in older adults, and was greater than reported by a previous meta-analysis evaluating the effects of other non- pharmacological interventions on muscle and bone strength including whole-body vibration , Tai Chi , and aer- obic training . The reduced likelihood for significant increases in BMD compared to muscle strength is perhaps due to the slower physiological response of bone to mechani- cal loading and/or that bone requires more time and more novel loading as well as higher dynamic strain rates to maximize positive adaptation 20–22. However, despite the reduced likelihood for significant increases in BMD of the femur/hip, some suggest that maintenance in BMD could be clinically relevant . Indeed, some studies that failed to identify changes in BMD following resistance training reported significant improvements in mobility e.g., timed up and go, chair stand, figure of 8 running 44, 60, 65, enhanced endurance , and a reduced risk of injurious falls ESM. Nine out of ten studies showed that the exercise training protocols did not improve BMD of the lumbar spine 40, 42–45, 58, 59, 63, 65. In fact, one study reported a signifi- cant decrease in BMD at this site compared with a control S. J. O’Bryan et al. group; although, the authors could not physiologically explain this response . The lack of change in lumbar spine BMD was somewhat surprising considering that five of the studies that reported no change had included specific back strengthening exercises e.g., lumbar extension, seated row, latissimus pull-down 40, 42, 45, 59, 65. However, these exercises were completed in a seated or prone posi- tion, which would considerably offset external load and strain placed through the lumbar spine, which is essential for triggering an osteogenic response. As such, it is pos- sible that more extensive compound exercises performed in the standing position and that promote gravitational loading through the lumbar spine may be necessary for improving BMD at this site . The magnitude of the increase in muscle strength and BMD following resistance training was not significantly affected by age 65–70 years vs. 70 years, although the 65- to 70-year-old group tended to exhibit a greater improvement compared with the 70-year-old group. The somewhat reduced capacity for the resistance training inter- vention to stimulate muscle and bone strength adaptation in the 70-year-old group may stem from the accelerated decline in neuromuscular structure and quality with advanc- ing age , which would subsequently reduce internal bone stress required to stimulate bone formation 20–22. How- ever, it is important to acknowledge that progressive resist- ance training remains an effective strategy for increasing muscle strength and bone formation into very old age 75 years. Participants in the normal BMI range exhibited greater improvements in muscle strength compared with their over- weight counterparts, whereas the change in BMD was not different between the groups. This result supports the blunt- ing effect of excess adipose tissue on strength adaptations to resistance training , which evolve from impairments in muscle protein metabolism and reduced muscle quality 76, 77. Thus, we support the recommendation of combin- ing progressive resistance training with a weight manage- ment program including 1 g of high-quality protein per kilogram of body weight per day and moderate-to-high- intensity aerobic weight-bearing exercises e.g., walking, stair climbing to maximize concomitant improvements in muscle strength and BMD in overweight individuals . on Concomitant Changes in Strength and BMD The sub-group meta-regression did not detect significant effects of the individual training characteristics on concomi- tant changes in muscle strength and femur/hip BMD, likely because of considerable heterogeneity in the outcomes. As such, it is difficult to make clear recommendations in terms of the effect of training mode, frequency, volume, load, and program length on concomitant changes in muscle strength and BMD. However, as muscle strength increased irrespec- tive of differences within the common training characteris- tics, whereas positive adaptation for femur/hip BMD was more heterogeneous and uncertain, we recommend that pro- grams adopt characteristics more likely to improve femur/ hip BMD. Despite a lack of statistical significance and wide CIs for the effects of the individual training characteristics on femur/hip BMD, the direction of the main effects may indicate that higher training frequencies enhance both out- comes, whereas mode, volume, and load may differentially affect strength and BMD. Resistance training frequencies of three times per week seemed to enhance concomitant improvements in muscle strength and femur/hip BMD compared with two times per week. Previous reviews and original studies have reported that higher training frequencies increase muscle cross-sec- tional area and strength 79–81, although these effects are minimized when equated for weekly training volume 79, 80. In terms of the bone response, higher training fre- quencies seem to facilitate BMD improvements following completion of weight-bearing/impact-loading programs 82, 83, but have less effect following resistance training pro- grams 65, 84, likely contributing to the wide CIs reported for the frequency effect on femur/hip BMD. As such, fre- quency effects on muscle may depend on volume, whereas frequency effects on BMD may be more dependent on mode. Of all the individual training characteristics, training mode had the largest effect on strength and bone adapta- tions. Traditional resistance training programs were signifi- cantly better for improving muscle strength, whereas add- ing a weight-bearing impact-loading component appeared to be better for improving femur/hip BMD. High-volume resistance training has been advocated as the most impor- tant factor for facilitating improvements in muscle strength and size . In contrast, resistance plus weight-bearing/ impact-loading protocols have been suggested to be superior for BMD improvements . Altogether, the evidence sug- gests that to maximize combined gains in muscle strength and BMD, it seems necessary to maintain resistance training volume while incorporating weight-bearing impact-loading exercises into the program. However, adding weight-bear- ing exercises to a resistance training session would in most cases reduce training volume and limit strength adapta- tions 25, 87. As such, one potential approach would be to perform resistance and weight-bearing/impact-loading activities on alternate days to mitigate a reduction in within- session resistance training volume. Indeed, 4/6 resistance plus weight-bearing/impact-loading studies included in this review combined these activities into a single session 46, 59, 61, 63, which likely decreased total resistance training volume and exacerbated differences in the strength response between the training modes. Conversely, Karinkanta et al. reported no statistical difference in strength and BMD between resistance-only and resistance plus weight-bearing/ impact-loading training when modes were performed on alternating days . Increasing the number of completed sets seemed to improve muscle strength, whereas fewer sets may be better for improving femur/hip BMD. The expression of signaling pathways known to promote myofibrillar protein synthesis e.g., insulin-like growth factor 1, Akt/mTOR is highly sen- sitive to changes in resistance training volume , which likely explains increased strength with an increased number of completed sets. Moreover, it is possible that higher train- ing volumes stimulate positive neuromuscular adaptations such as motor unit remodeling and a type IIa fiber type shift . However, the mechanosensitivity of bone declines soon after a stimulus is initiated, meaning that if the load is ade- quate, increasing volume provides no additional osteogenic benefit 90, 91. In support of this, Taaffe et al. reported no additional benefit to BMD when resistance training at 80%1RM was completed once, twice, or three times per week. Moreover, Cunha et al. reported that three sets of resistance training increased muscle strength compared with one set, but had no additional benefit to BMD in osteosarco- penic women . Despite this, of the eight studies included in this review that evaluated the effect of one or two sets per exercise on strength and BMD outcomes 40–42, 45, 46, 59, 62, 63, all but one that used elastic bands reported increased muscle strength and six reported increased femur/ hip BMD 41, 42, 46, 59, 62, 63. This is in contrast to the eight studies that evaluated the effect of three sets per exercise 40, 41, 43, 44, 58, 60, 61, 65, which all reported increased muscle strength but only one reported an increase in femur/hip BMD . Indeed, meta-regression showed that training volume had the second largest main effect on femur/hip BMD behind training mode and, therefore, is an important variable to consider when targeting bone forma- tion with progressive resistance training. Although a physio- logical explanation for the observed favorable effect of lower training volumes on femur/hip BMD is unclear, a higher volume of resistance training may induce fatigue and require a reduction in the external load, subsequently reducing bone strain and the osteogenic response 18, 92. Unfortunately, none of the included studies specified if the load remained constant within a session or if repetitions were completed to failure, which could provide insight into participant fatigue development during training sessions. The external load %1RM had minimal effect on muscle strength, whereas external loads of 75–80% 1RM seemed better for improving the BMD response. Previous meta-anal- yses have advocated higher external loads for facilitating strength adaptations in older men and women . Rea- sons for discrepancy may evolve from a higher percentage of female individuals in our study 92% vs 50/50 split. Resistance Training for Muscle and Bone Strength in Older Adults S. J. O’Bryan et al. Higher intensity loads tend to favor older male individuals compared with female individuals , potentially because women display a failure to downregulate myostatin after resistance loading compared with age-matched men , and older men exhibit greater anti-inflammatory benefits in response to external loads compared with women . In terms of BMD, heightened mechanical loads stimulate bone modeling and remodeling to increase bone mass and bone stiffness 92, 95, and the higher loads advocated here are in agreeance with current recommendations for optimizing BMD in older adults . However, a recent meta-analysis by Souza et al. reported similar effects of high ≥ 70% 1RM and low 70% 1RM load resistance training on BMD in male and female adults aged ≥ 45 years. Taken together, it is possible that the effects of the external load on BMD may be influenced by hormonal changes with age i.e., middle-aged vs old age and/or if resistance training is performed in conjunction with weight-bearing exercises. Limitations of the evidence include a lack of specific details pertaining to the rate of mechanical loading/move- ment velocity , time under tension , contraction type , and whether repetitions were completed to fail- ure , some of which may explain some of the reported heterogeneity and lack of significant effects for the indi- vidual training characteristics. Moreover, seven studies reported range values for load, sets, and/or repetitions 45, 46, 59–63 and two studies utilized elastic bands during resistance training 44, 46, likely increasing inter-individ- ual variability in the strength and BMD responses. Last, the underrepresentation of older male participants 8% of the total sample makes it difficult to determine whether similar concomitant changes in muscle strength and BMD following progressive resistance training exist between the sexes. A sub-group meta-regression to determine sex differences was not conducted as sufficient data were not available for male and female individuals separately. The PRISMA guidelines were adhered to in preparation of this review, although some limitations of the processes should be acknowledged. For example, the omission of gray literature, conference abstracts, and peer- reviewed articles not published in English poses some risk of publication bias. Moreover, if a single study included multiple intervention groups with different training char- acteristics e.g., control vs. varying loads or frequencies 40–42, 65, it was necessary to pool these data into a sin- gle intervention group, potentially influencing sub-group meta-regression. However, the results of the sub-group analysis were in line with the overall conclusions from each of these studies. Future research needs to carefully consider and report specific details pertaining to exercise training principles beyond mode, frequency, volume, load, and program length, so that the actual effects of these variables on concomitant changes in muscle strength and BMD can be clearly defined. Although maximal strength is a pri- mary indicator of skeletal muscle health and function in older adults, the ability to produce high forces at fast con- traction velocities i.e., power may be a better predictor of function and fatigue . Moreover, although BMD may explain 60–70% of total bone strength , bone architecture and matrix components are also crucial for bone strength and may better predict frac- ture risk . Future research may consider combining techniques such as force–velocity profiling and quantita- tive computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to concurrently assess changes in muscle strength, contraction velocity, and power production as well as trabecular architecture and matrix components such as mineral, collagen, water, and non-collagenous proteins. An increase in the representation of male par- ticipants in future research is also warranted. Progressive resistance training programs concomitantly increase lower-limb muscle strength and femur/hip BMD in older adults. However, whereas improvements in muscle strength occur regardless of manipulation to well-known training characteristics, positive adaptations in femur/hip BMD are less certain. As such, to promote concomitant increases in muscle strength and BMD, we recommend adopting training characteristics more likely to facilitate improvements in BMD, which may include resistance train- ing with a weight-bearing/impact-loading component, train- ing frequency three times weekly, training volume of one or two sets per exercise, and an external load of 75–80% 1RM.
