Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated means are as follows: Mean: An estimated mean is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Indicates a non-zero value too small to report. Abbreviations SE = standard error; RAE = retinol activity equivalents; DFE = dietary folate equivalents. SFA = saturated fatty acid; MFA = monounsaturated fatty acid; PFA = polyunsaturated fatty acid. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated means are as follows: Mean: An estimated mean is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Indicates a non-zero value too small to report. Footnotes blacks, low-income whites/others, and whites/others 80+ years. Abbreviations SE = standard error; RAE = retinol activity equivalents; DFE = dietary folate equivalents. SFA = saturated fatty acid; MFA = monounsaturated fatty acid; PFA = polyunsaturated fatty acid. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated means are as follows: Mean: An estimated mean is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Indicates a non-zero value too small to report. Footnotes Abbreviations SE = standard error; RAE = retinol activity equivalents; DFE = dietary folate equivalents. SFA = saturated fatty acid; MFA = monounsaturated fatty acid; PFA = polyunsaturated fatty acid. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated means are as follows: Mean: An estimated mean is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Indicates a non-zero value too small to report. Footnotes Abbreviations SE = standard error; RAE = retinol activity equivalents; DFE = dietary folate equivalents. SFA = saturated fatty acid; MFA = monounsaturated fatty acid; PFA = polyunsaturated fatty acid. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

The rules for flagging estimated means and percentages are as follows: Mean: An estimated mean is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Percent: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction.

Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated percentages and ratios are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Nutrient ratios expressed as percentages: An estimated ratio between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size n of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect and n is the number of individuals in the sample reporting non-zero intake of the respective nutrient. An estimated ratio less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent, is flagged when the smaller of np and n 1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. Additionally, an estimated ratio is flagged when either the relative standard error or p/1-p times the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Footnotes unit. nutrient intakes are available from: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. See Table 1. Nutrient Intakes from Food and Beverages: Mean Amounts Consumed per Individual, by Gender and Age, in the United States, 2015-2016. Abbreviations SE = standard error; RAE = retinol activity equivalents; DFE = dietary folate equivalents. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated percentages and ratios are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Nutrient ratios expressed as percentages: An estimated ratio between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size n of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect and n is the number of individuals in the sample reporting non-zero intake of the respective nutrient. An estimated ratio less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent, is flagged when the smaller of np and n 1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. Additionally, an estimated ratio is flagged when either the relative standard error or p/1-p times the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Footnotes unit. nutrient intakes are available from: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. See Table 4. Nutrient Intakes from Food and Beverages: Mean Amounts Consumed per Individual, by Family Income as % of Poverty Level and Age, in the United States, 2015-2016. Abbreviations SE = standard error; RAE = retinol activity equivalents; DFE = dietary folate equivalents. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated percentages and ratios are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Nutrient ratios expressed as percentages: An estimated ratio between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size n of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect and n is the number of individuals in the sample reporting non-zero intake of the respective nutrient. An estimated ratio less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent, is flagged when the smaller of np and n 1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. Additionally, an estimated ratio is flagged when either the relative standard error or p/1-p times the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Footnotes consumption of beverages including water. www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. See Table 1. Nutrient Intakes from Food and Beverages: Mean Amounts Consumed per Individual, by Gender and Age, in the United States, 2015-2016. Abbreviations SE = standard error; RAE = retinol activity equivalents; DFE = dietary folate equivalents. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

The rules for flagging estimated percentages and ratios are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Nutrient ratios expressed as percentages: An estimated ratio between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size n of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect and n is the number of individuals in the sample reporting non-zero intake of the respective nutrient. An estimated ratio less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent, is flagged when the smaller of np and n 1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where p is the percentage expressed as a fraction.

Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

The rules for flagging estimated percentages and ratios are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Nutrient ratios expressed as percentages: An estimated ratio between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size n of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect and n is the number of individuals in the sample reporting non-zero intake of the respective nutrient. An estimated ratio less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent, is flagged when the smaller of np and n 1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. Additionally, an estimated ratio is flagged when either the relative standard error or p/1-p times the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Indicates a non-zero value too small to report. Footnotes consumption of beverages including water. www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. See Table 4.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated percentages and ratios are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Nutrient ratios expressed as percentages: An estimated ratio between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size n of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect and n is the number of individuals in the sample reporting non-zero intake of the respective nutrient. An estimated ratio less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent, is flagged when the smaller of np and n 1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. Additionally, an estimated ratio is flagged when either the relative standard error or p/1-p times the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Footnotes including water. www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. See Table 1. Nutrient Intakes from Food and Beverages: Mean Amounts Consumed per Individual, by Gender and Age, in the United States, 2015-2016. Abbreviations SE = standard error; RAE = retinol activity equivalents; DFE = dietary folate equivalents. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated percentages and ratios are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Nutrient ratios expressed as percentages: An estimated ratio between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size n of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect and n is the number of individuals in the sample reporting non-zero intake of the respective nutrient. An estimated ratio less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent, is flagged when the smaller of np and n 1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. Additionally, an estimated ratio is flagged when either the relative standard error or p/1-p times the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated percentages and ratios are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Nutrient ratios expressed as percentages: An estimated ratio between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size n of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect and n is the number of individuals in the sample reporting non-zero intake of the respective nutrient. An estimated ratio less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent, is flagged when the smaller of np and n 1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. Additionally, an estimated ratio is flagged when either the relative standard error or p/1-p times the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Footnotes including water. www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. See Table 1. Nutrient Intakes from Food and Beverages: Mean Amounts Consumed per Individual, by Gender and Age, in the United States, 2015-2016. Abbreviations SE = standard error; RAE = retinol activity equivalents; DFE = dietary folate equivalents. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated percentages and ratios are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Nutrient ratios expressed as percentages: An estimated ratio between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size n of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect and n is the number of individuals in the sample reporting non-zero intake of the respective nutrient. An estimated ratio less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent, is flagged when the smaller of np and n 1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. Additionally, an estimated ratio is flagged when either the relative standard error or p/1-p times the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated percentages and ratios are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Nutrient ratios expressed as percentages: An estimated ratio between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size n of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect and n is the number of individuals in the sample reporting non-zero intake of the respective nutrient. An estimated ratio less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent, is flagged when the smaller of np and n 1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. Additionally, an estimated ratio is flagged when either the relative standard error or p/1-p times the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Footnotes reported in approximately 27 percent of the snack occasions. Survey respondents selected the name of all eating occasions from a fixed list that was provided during the interview. All reports of "snack", "drink" or "extended consumption" items that were consumed over a long period of time were included as snack occasions. Spanish language interviewers used Spanish language snack occasion names: "merienda", "entre comida", "botana", "bocadillo", "tentempie", and "bebida". www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. See Table 1. Nutrient Intakes from Food and Beverages: Mean Amounts Consumed per Individual, by Gender and Age, in the United States, 2015-2016. Abbreviations SE = standard error; RAE = retinol activity equivalents; DFE = dietary folate equivalents. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

The rules for flagging estimated percentages and ratios are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Nutrient ratios expressed as percentages: An estimated ratio between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size n of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect and n is the number of individuals in the sample reporting non-zero intake of the respective nutrient. An estimated ratio less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent, is flagged when the smaller of np and n 1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. Additionally, an estimated ratio is flagged when either the relative standard error or p/1-p times the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Footnotes reported in approximately 27 percent of the snack occasions. Survey respondents selected the name of all eating occasions from a fixed list that was provided during the interview. All reports of "snack", "drink" or "extended consumption" items that were consumed over a long period of time were included as snack occasions. Spanish language interviewers used Spanish language snack occasion names: "merienda", "entre comida", "botana", "bocadillo", "tentempie", and "bebida". www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. See Table 2. Nutrient Intakes from Food and Beverages: Mean Amounts Consumed per Individual, by Race/Ethnicity and Age, in the United States, 2015-2016. blacks, low-income whites/others, and whites/others 80+ years. Abbreviations SE = standard error; RAE = retinol activity equivalents; DFE = dietary folate equivalents. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Additionally, an estimated ratio is flagged when either the relative standard error or p/1-p times the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. Footnotes reported in approximately 27 percent of the snack occasions. Survey respondents selected the name of all eating occasions from a fixed list that was provided during the interview. All reports of "snack", "drink" or "extended consumption" items that were consumed over a long period of time were included as snack occasions. Spanish language interviewers used Spanish language snack occasion names: "merienda", "entre comida", "botana", "bocadillo", "tentempie", and "bebida". www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. See Table 3.

Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction.

The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.

Available: www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Symbol Legend Indicates an estimate that may be less statistically reliable than estimates that are not flagged. The rules for flagging estimated percentages are as follows: Percent reporting: An estimated percentage between 25 and 75 percent is flagged when based on a sample size of less than 30 times the variance inflation factor VIF, where the VIF represents a broadly calculated average design effect, or when the relative standard error is greater than 30 percent. An estimated percentage less than or equal to 25 percent or greater than or equal to 75 percent is flagged when the smaller of np and n1-p is less than 8 times the VIF, where n is the sample size and p is the percentage expressed as a fraction. The VIF used in this table is 2.41. What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Indicates a non-zero value too small to report. Footnotes Breakfast, lunch, and dinner: the respondent reported each of the three meals as follows: breakfast includes all eating occasions designated by the respondent as "breakfast", or the Spanish equivalents "desayuno", and "almuerzo"; lunch includes all eating occasions designated as "brunch", "lunch" or the Spanish equivalent "comida"; and dinner includes all eating occasions designated as "dinner", "supper", or the Spanish equivalent "cena". Any two meals: the respondent reported any combination of two of the three meals -- breakfast, lunch or dinner. Any one meal or less: the respondent reported one of the three meals, or no meal. reported in approximately 27 percent of the snack occasions. Survey respondents selected the name of all eating occasions from a fixed list that was provided during the interview. All reports of "snack", "drink" or "extended consumption" items that were consumed over a long period of time were included as snack occasions. Spanish language interviewers used Spanish language snack occasion names: "merienda", "entre comida", "botana", "bocadillo", "tentempie", and "bebida". Abbreviations SE standard error. Notes Applicable to All Tables in Series: What We Eat in America, NHANES 2015-2016 Sample weights designed for dietary analysis were used to allow estimates representative of the U. S. population for the years of collection. The statistics in this table are estimated from Day 1 dietary recall interviews conducted in the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES 2015-2016. The 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted in-person, by trained interviewers, using the USDA 5-step Automated Multiple-Pass Method. Food intakes were coded and nutrient values were determined using the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2015-2016 www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg. Intakes of nutrients and other dietary components are based on the consumption of food and beverages, including water, and do not include intake from supplements or medications. The table includes data from individuals 2 years and over. Breast-fed children were excluded because breast milk was not quantified in dietary recall interviews. Although alcohol data are collected for all individuals, estimates are not presented for age groups under 20 years due to extreme variability and/or inadequate sample size.
