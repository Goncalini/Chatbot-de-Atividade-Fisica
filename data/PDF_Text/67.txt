Functional and mechanistic studies that employ animal exercise models as well as observational and interventional cohort studies with human participants, have contributed considerably in delineating the essential signaling pathways by which exercise promotes cardiovascular ﬁtness and health. First, this review summarizes the beneﬁcial impact of exercise on multiple aspects of cardiovascular health. We then discuss in detail the signaling pathways mediating exercise’s beneﬁts for cardiovascular health. The exercise-regulated signaling cascades have been shown to confer myocardial protection and drive systemic adaptations. The signaling molecules that are necessary for exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy have the potential to attenuate myocardial injury and reverse cardiac remodeling. Exercise-regulated noncoding RNAs and their associated signaling pathways are also discussed in detail for their roles and mechanisms in exercise-induced cardioprotective effects. Moreover, we address the exercise-mediated signaling pathways and molecules that can serve as potential therapeutic targets ranging from pharmacological approaches to gene therapies in CVD. We also discuss multiple factors that inﬂuence exercise’s effect and highlight the importance and need for further investigations regarding the exercise-regulated molecules as therapeutic targets and biomarkers for CVD as well as the cross talk between the heart and other tissues or organs during exercise. We conclude that a deep understanding of the signaling pathways involved in exercise’s beneﬁts for cardiovascular health will undoubtedly contribute to the identiﬁcation and development of novel therapeutic targets and strategies for CVD. Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022 7:306 ; : , ; Cardiovascular disease CVD remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide.1 Data from a myriad of clinical and basic research studies have demonstrated the beneﬁcial effects of exercise training on cardiovascular health, while physical inactivity has long been considered as a critical cardiovascular risk factor for the development of CVD.2,3 An accumulating body of cohort studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have documented the beneﬁcial effects of physical activity in reducing cardiovascular risk factors and risk of cardiovascular events.4–7 Moreover, appropriate physical activity also improves cardiorespiratory ﬁtness and reduces all-cause mortality and CVD mortality.8–13 The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at for children and adolescents, and 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity combined with In fact, a recommendation for physical activity has been set in place and addresses the healthy population of all age groups. The recommend appropriate physical activity for the pregnant and post-partum women, older adults ≥65 years, and disabled people as well.15 The 2020 WHO guidelines recommend physical activity least 60 min of physical activity daily, of moderate to vigorous intensity across all age groups and abilities.16 Owing to the fast-paced rhythm of living in modern societies, a vast majority of the population fails to meet the physical activity recommendation. However, increasing evidence indicates that even low levels of physical activity can be beneﬁcial compared to inactivity.16 In fact, physical activity below the recommended daily level was still found to be associated with reduced all-cause mortality and extended life expectancy even for those at risk for CVD.17 In addition to the encouraging beneﬁts of physical activity in the healthy population, exercise training has also been prescribed as medicine for different CVD.18 In clinical interventions, appro- priate exercise training has been proven to enhance exercise capacity and cardiorespiratory ﬁtness, reduce hospitalization, and improve life quality in patients with hypertension, coronary heart disease CHD, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure HF.19 Exercise plays a crucial role in both primary and secondary prevention of HF.20 Indeed, increasing research interest has been focused on the mechanisms of exercise’s beneﬁts for cardiovascular health. Animal exercise models are useful tools to investigate and decipher the functional and molecular mechanisms of exercise- induced protection.21 Animal studies focused on cardiovascular health and diseases have demonstrated multifaceted beneﬁcial 1School of Basic Medical Science, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China; 2Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Organ Repair, School of Medicine, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China; 3Cardiac Regeneration and Ageing Lab, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, School of Life Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China and 4Cardiovascular Division of the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA Correspondence: Rong Lu or Yihua Bei or Junjie Xiao These authors contributed equally: Huihua Chen, Chen Chen.

Next, we will address the exercise-mediated signaling pathways and molecules that can serve as potential therapeutic targets ranging from pharmacolo- gical approaches to gene therapies in CVD. The understandings of molecular pathway underlying exercise’s beneﬁts for cardiovas- cular health will help promote the exercise training in both healthy population and patients with CVD, and develop novel therapeutic targets and strategies for CVD. Exercise training can exert beneﬁcial effects for cardiovascular health on multiple aspects. Physiologically, acute exercise increases the sympathetic activity while reduces the parasympa- thetic activity which releases catecholamines and subsequently increases heart rate and cardiac contractility. Meanwhile, exercise increases the blood ﬂow back to the heart leading to increased left ventricle end-diastolic volume and force of contraction Frank- Starling mechanism. Taken together, these physiological changes lead to increased stoke volume, heart rate, and cardiac output in response to acute exercise.28 A systematic review has recently reported that moderate-intensity of acute aerobic exercise is effective to reduce stress-induced blood pressure reactivity which may promote cardiovascular health.29 In response to chronic exercise, the heart and other tissues or organs will have both structural and functional adaptive changes which confer the beneﬁcial effect of exercise. In the following part, we will discuss in the beneﬁcial effects of chronic exercise training for detail cardiovascular health from multiple aspects Fig. 1, including reducing cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular events, mitigating myocardial oxidative stress, promoting physiological cardiac hypertrophy and inducing vascular, cardiometabolic and systemic adaptations. Exercise reduces cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular events The beneﬁcial effect of exercise in reducing traditional cardiovas- cular risk factors, such as body mass index, total cholesterol, and blood pressure, are widely recognized.3 Moderate to vigorous physical activity has been shown to be associated with lower cardiometabolic risks, including blood pressure, glucose, insulin, and waist circumference, in US youth from 6 to 17 years.30 Meta- randomized controlled trials RCTs demonstrated analysis of beneﬁcial effects of walking as an exercise intervention for cardiovascular risk factors such as body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and fasting glucose in adults.31 Notably, exercise exerts favorable effects in reducing cardiovascular risk factors independently of the age group.5,6,30,31 Moreover, increas- ing number of prospective cohort studies and meta-analyses demonstrate that exercise reduces mortality and cardiovascular events. A large prospective cohort study across 17 countries reported that higher physical activity was associated with a lower risk of mortality and cardiovascular events.32 A Chinese population-based prospective cohort study in 10 areas across China showed that higher physical activity was associated with reduced risk of major vascular and coronary events.33 Physical activity was also shown to be associated with a lower incidence of Cholesterol, glucose, etc. Blood Pressure BMI CV risk factors incidence of CV events ROS production Antioxidant capacity Myocardial oxidative stress Lymphangiogenesis Cardiac angiogenesis Vascular responses Endothelium dependent- vasodilation Exercise Physiological cardiac hypertrophy Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, proliferation Anti-apoptosis Systemic responses Metabolic adaptations Skeletal muscle EVs Vessel Metabolites Brown adipose tissue Gut microbiota Fatty acid oxidation Glucose utilization depends on exercise form ATP production Fig. 1 Beneﬁcial effects of exercise training in cardiovascular health.

Exercise reduces myocardial oxidative stress Increased reactive oxygen species ROS production and altered antioxidant capacity represents a critical contributor to myocardial injury under pathological conditions and during the aging process.35 The heart contains a large number of mitochondria, which is an essential source of cellular ROS production.36 In addition, endothelial cells and neutrophils in the heart are also important sources of ROS production.37 Treadmill running rodent exercise studies demonstrated that exercise was effective to increase the protein abundance and/or activity of superoxide dismutase SOD1 and SOD2, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase in the mitochondria fraction isolated from ventricular myocytes.23 Increased ROS production plays a key role in the development of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion I/R injury.38 Numerous studies have provided evidence supporting that exercise training is an I/R injury.39–41 effective intervention which reduces myocardial The protective effect of exercise against I/R injury was shown to be closely related to exercise-enhanced myocardial antioxidant capacity.39 In fact, exercise was shown to reduce the infarct size after myocardial I/R injury, an effect which was abolished by suppressing SOD2.40,41 In the early phase after I/R injury, ROS production was markedly lower in the hearts of exercised mice than sedentary mice.42 Mechanistically, exercise induced the endothelial nitric oxidase eNOS/nitric oxide NO and protein S‑nitrosylation pathway in the mitochondria, leading to reduced mitochondrial ROS production and mitochondrial permeability transition pore mPTP activation and thus, conveying cardiopro- tection against I/R injury.42 Further studies are needed to identify speciﬁc targets involved in exercise-induced protection against myocardial oxidative stress. Exercise promotes physiological cardiac hypertrophy Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in heart mass, and can be categorized as physiological or pathological cardiac hypertrophy.43 Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is commonly associated with diverse etiologies such as hypertension, arterial stenosis, myocardial infarction, and dilated cardiomyopathy, which progressively leads to cardiac remodeling and heart failure.44,45 Conversely, physiological cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive and reversible cardiac growth that appears upon chronic exercise stimulation and exerts cardiac protective effects.46,47 Exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy exhibits multi- ple distinct characteristics that are different from pathological cardiac hypertrophy.48 From a structural and functional standpoint, endurance training such as swimming and long-distance running induces a volume overload which leads to eccentric cardiac hypertrophy, as characterized by a proportional change in ventricle wall thickness and chamber enlargement. On the contrary, strength training or pathological stimuli such as hypertension or aortic constriction causes concentric cardiac hypertrophy, as characterized by thickening of the left ventricle wall and a small reduction or no change in chamber size.48 Physiological cardiac hypertrophy does not develop myocardial apoptosis or cardiac ﬁbrosis, and usually maintains normal or increased cardiac function. Furthermore, there is no expression change of fetal genes such as ANP, BNP, and β-MHC. Exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy exhibits adaptive protein synthesis and increased levels of fatty acid and glucose oxidation which help ensure cardiomyocyte growth and ATP production.22,24 Using animal exercise models of swimming, running, different research groups were able to show that exercise- induced cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by both hypertrophy running, and voluntary wheel treadmill Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022 7:306 Exercise training maintains cardiovascular health: signaling pathways. . . Chen et al. and proliferation of cardiomyocytes.47,49 Exercise-induced physio- logical cardiac growth exhibits increased proliferation markers in cardiomyocytes such as EdU, Ki67, and phosphorylated histone H3 pHH3.47,49–51 Current evidence indicates that exercise-induced cardiac cell proliferation, including cardiomyocyte proliferation, is necessary to mediate exercise’s beneﬁt in preventing cardiac I/R injury.52 Recent evidence shows that exercise-induced cardiac protection is closely related to physiological hypertrophy, enhanced of and cardiomyocytes.22 proliferation, apoptosis blunted From a molecular standpoint, different signaling pathways are involved in physiological cardiac hypertrophy compared to pathological cardiac hypertrophy.48 Deciphering the different molecular mechanisms between physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy may provide novel therapeutic targets for CVD. It has been known that angiotensin II Ang II, endothelin-1 ET-1, norepinephrine, and their downstream signaling pathways e.g., calcineurin, mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK, and calmodulin contribute to the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.48,53 While the insulin growth factor-1/ phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase B IGF1/PI3K/Akt path- way and the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β C/EBPβ/CITED4 pathway are canonical signaling pathways that have been well described for exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy. With the increasing interest and under- standing of the epigenetics and post-transcriptional regulation, the noncoding RNA-regulated signaling pathways have been identiﬁed in the exercised heart.37,46,47,51 Notably, the regulatory molecules contributing to exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy have the potential to exert cardiovascular protective effects.54 The signaling pathways and molecular aspects of exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy and cardio- vascular protection will be discussed later in detail Table 1. Exercise induces vascular responses Due to the increased demand for oxygen and energy during exercise, the cardiac vasculature responds in multiple ways. The accelerated heart rate and blood ﬂow induce an increase in vascular shear stress, which further activates eNOS activity and promotes NO production from vascular endothelial cells.55 Exercise-induced activation of β3-adrenoceptor β3-AR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor VEGFR also lead to NO production from vascular and cardiac endothelial cells.56 In the vasculature, endothelium-released NO diffuses into adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells and further leads to cGMP- dependent smooth muscle cell relaxation and vasodilation. The eNOS can be located in both endothelium and cardiomyocytes, and evidence indicates that exercise predominantly activates eNOS phosphorylation in coronary endothelium, but not in cardiomyocytes, to mediate the protective effect of exercise against I/R injury through improving endothelium-dependent coronary relaxation.57 In the myocardium, cardiac endothelium- derived NO or increased myocardial NO availability exerts multiple cardioprotective functions through modulating mitochondrial inhibiting β1-AR-induced contractility, and inducing respiration, cGMP-dependent relaxation of myocytes.24,58,59 On the other hand, cardiac endothelium-derived NO plays a key role in cardiac It has been well established that angiogenesis during exercise. pathological cardiac hypertrophy or myocardial ischemia injury are often associated with inadequate angiogenesis. Conversely, exercise training can induce proportional angiogenesis and dilation of the coronary vasculature to facilitate physiological required oxygen and cardiac hypertrophy and delivery of nutrients to the myocardium upon exercise.60 Furthermore, HIF1α and exercise can upregulate hypoxia-inducible factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α PGC1α in the heart, leading to production of VEGF which is a for angiogenesis.61 Exercise can also stimulate crucial factor Exercise training maintains cardiovascular health: signaling pathways. . .

Exercise induces cardiac metabolic adaptations Exercise is a physiological stressor which increases the hemody- namic function and energy production of the body. Cardiac mitochondria response dynamically to exercise to maintain cellular homeostasis and metabolic energy supply through the process of fusion, ﬁssion, and mitophagy.69,70 In response to acute increased cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ promotes exercise, activity, increasing ATP production through ATPase Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022 7:306 dehydrogenase activity, and NADH oxidation.71,72 Meanwhile, acute exercise can rapidly induce mitochondrial ﬁssion to increase the number and surface area of mitochondria through activating dynamin-related protein 1 Drp1.73 During chronic exercise, PGC1α and eNOS activations enhance mitochondrial biogen- esis.74,75 In addition, exercise can also induce repeated cycle of mitochondrial ﬁssion and mitophagy to improve mitochondrial quality control.76,77 Glucose and fatty acids are the major sources of ATP production in the heart. Under physiological baseline conditions, fatty acid oxidative phosphorylation is responsible for 40–70% cardiac ATP production and glucose oxidative phosphorylation is responsible for 20%–30% cardiac ATP production.78 However, under patholo- gical conditions such as myocardial infarction, pathological hypertrophy, and heart failure, a metabolic switch in energy substrate preference from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation is undergone by the heart.79 This is partly due to the fact that fatty acid oxidation requires more oxygen and that the incomplete fatty acid β-oxidation causes accumulation of mal- ondialdehyde MDA in the myocardium.80,81 However, glycolysis consumes less oxygen and its oxidative phosphorylation products, H2O and CO2, are non-toxic and safe for the heart.82 Compared to pathological conditions, exercise training induces distinct metabolic changes in the heart. Exercise increases cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen consumption, leading to increased rate of ATP production. These changes may increase myocardial carbohydrate and fatty acid catabolism.83 However, glucose uptake and oxidation can be diminished due to high levels of lactate or free fatty acids upon exercise training.83,84 At the same time, the increased lactate and free fatty acid levels will promote fatty acid uptake and utilization.83,85 Treadmill running exercise was found to be protective against myocardial I/R injury in female exercised rats, associated with increased fatty acid and glucose oxidation and reduced glycolysis.86 Swimming exercise was shown to attenuate acute myocardial infarction through positively regulating the genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and activating the PGC1α, PPARα, and PPARγ.87 In fact, different increase or intensity, and duration can either exercise type, decrease the uptake and utilization of glucose.79 In a mouse model that underwent swimming exercise, it was shown that exercise-induced adaptations lead to physiological cardiac hyper- trophy and increased glycolysis, glucose oxidation, fatty acid oxidation, and ATP production.88 However, a study involving a mouse model of treadmill running exercise reported that glucose utilization through glycolysis was reduced immediately after a bout of acute exercise through reduced phosphofructokinase PFK activity, while the myocardial glycolysis was adaptively running.89 The study also increased after chronic treadmill revealed that low myocardial glycolytic activity was able to induce an increase in cardiac size, an adaptation similar to the exercise- induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy.89 The PPAR, PGC1α, AMPK signaling pathways have been shown to regulate the expressions of fatty acid oxidation genes, glycolytic genes, and mitochondrial biogenesis genes upon exercise.90,91 However, the periodicity and dynamic changes of cardiac metabolic adaptations upon exercise training and its contribution to physiological cardiac hypertrophy and exercise-induced cardiovascular protection require further investigation. Exercise induces systemic responses Exercise is an effective modality that induces systemic responses in the body and promotes the release of various factors such as peptides, metabolites, mRNAs, and non-coding RNAs into the circulation, which then have the potential to participate in a systemic crosstalk and reach all organs and tissues, including the heart. Current research interest has been focused on the responses and functional roles of extracellular vesicles EVs such as small EVs eg. exosomes of 30–150 nm and large EVs e.g. Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022 7:306 Exercise training maintains cardiovascular health: signaling pathways. . . Chen et al. microparticles of 100–1000 nm in the exercised body.92,93 EVs are small lipid double-layer membrane vesicles containing a variety of biological contents such as RNA, proteins, and lipids, which convey vital signals among cells and mediate intercellular communications.94 Many studies have investigated whether and how circulating EVs were changed upon different types of exercise. A systematic review has indicated that a single bout of exercise can induce a transient increase of circulating micro- particles CMPs in healthy subjects, while chronically trained subjects may have an unchanged or low level of circulating CMPs due to their adaptations to exercise.92 The variable changes of circulating EVs after exercise can be inﬂuenced by multiple factors, such as exercise form type, frequency, duration, time of blood draw, origin of EVs, as well as age and sex of exercised individuals.92,95,96 Emerging evidence has revealed the essential contribution of exercise-derived EVs to cardiovascular health. A 3-week swimming exercise was shown to increase the serum EV numbers in mice, and exercise-induced increase in circulating EV numbers further enhanced the protective effect of endogenous EVs against I/R injury and myocardial apoptosis.97 In another myocardial study using swimming exercised rat model, exercise-derived EVs were shown to have signiﬁcant protective effect against myocardial I/R injury through their cargos containing miR-342- 5p.26 Notably, endothelial cells were shown to be the major source of circulating exosomal miR-342-5p after exercise.26 In addition to the circulating EVs, brown adipose tissue was reported to be another source of exercise-derived cardioprotective EVs.25 Further- more, small EVs secreted by brown adipose tissue mediated the protective effect of exercise against myocardial I/R injury through miR-125b-5p, miR-128-3p, and miR-30d-5p.25 In addition, exercise was also shown to inﬂuence the composi- tion and metabolites of gut microbiome, which may play essential roles in regulating CVD.98,99 Both human and animal studies demonstrate that exercise can lead to higher richness and diversity of the gut microbiome.98–100 Treadmill running exercise was shown to be efﬁcient in reducing myocardial injury post infarction in mice through rescuing gut microbial richness and bacterial community structure.101 Furthermore, two metabolites, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 3-HPA and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid 4- HBA, were identiﬁed to play essential roles in mediating beneﬁcial infarction through NRF2.101 Under- effects against myocardial standing the systemic responses that are activated upon exercise will lead to more considerate exercise interventions and therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular health. SIGNALING PATHWAYS MEDIATING EXERCISE’S BENEFITS FOR IGF1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway The IGF1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway has been well described for its essential role in mediating exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial protection Fig. 2. IGF1 is a hormone that can be released by both the liver and the heart. The increased cardiac and serum IGF1 levels have been observed in trained athletes with physiological cardiac hypertrophy.102,103 Exercise-induced IGF1 activates IGF1 receptor IGF1R tyrosine kinase, which can recruit the SH2 domain-containing protein such as the p85 regulatory subunit of Class IA PI3K.104 The lipid kinase Class IA PI3Ks contain different isoforms; one isoform which consists of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110α catalytic subunit is the major PI3K isoform that plays important role in postnatal and exercise-induced cardiac growth as well as in exercise- induced cardiac protection.105 The p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K, through converting phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate PIP2 to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate PIP3 in the plasma membrane, leads to recruitment of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 PDK1 and AKT to the plasma membrane.

SERCR2a Pathological hypertrophy Fig. 2 The IGF1/PI3K/AKT pathway in exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy and exercise-induced cardioprotection. Exercise induces IGF1 secretion, which activates IGF1R tyrosine kinase followed by recruitment of PI3K. The PI3K through converting PIP2 to PIP3 in the plasma membrane, further leads to recruitment of PDK1 and AKT to the plasma membrane and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of PDK1 and AKT. The activation of IGF1/PI3K/AKT is essential to mediate exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy through promoting cardiomyocyte growth in size. The IGF1/PI3K/AKT pathway also exerts cardioprotective effects through promoting cardiomyocyte contractility, enhancing survival while reducing apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, inhibiting pathological hypertrophy, and promoting angiogenesis. IGF1 insulin growth factor 1, IGFR1 insulin growth factor 1 receptor, PI3K phosphoinositide-3 kinase, PIP2 phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PIP3 phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, PDK1 phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1, AKT protein kinase B, PTEN phosphatase and tensin homolog, mTORC2 mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2, SERCA2a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a AKT with PIP3 leads to the conformational change and exposure of its phosphorylation sites Ser473 and Thr308. Finally, PIP3- induced phosphorylation of PDK1 leads to AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 and the mTOR complex 2 mTORC2 leads to AKT phosphorylation at Ser473.106 A large number of studies using gene transgenic TG and knockout KO mice have revealed the critical involvement of IGF1/ PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy.105 Cardiac IGF1R overexpression induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy in mice, which was however blunted by cardiomyocyte-speciﬁc co-expression of a dominant negative PI3KdnPI3K p110α mutant.107 Cardiomyocyte-speciﬁc IGF1R knock- out mice did not develop physiological cardiac hypertrophy after demonstrated that cardiac-constitutively active PI3K caPI3K TG mice had larger hearts, while cardiac expression of a dnPI3K p110α mutant resulted in smaller hearts.109 Moreover, mice with cardiac expression of a dnPI3K p110α mutant had blunted cardiac hypertrophic adaptations to swimming exercise.110 Despite a number of studies that reported somewhat conﬂicting results regarding the different cardiac phenotypes in response to increased AKT activity, it has currently been recognized that short-term appropriate AKT activation leads to physiological cardiac hypertrophy, while long-term AKT activation or AKT overexpression causes pathological cardiac failure.111–115 interstitial ﬁbrosis, and even heart hypertrophy, However, AKT KO mice were resistant to develop physiological cardiac hypertrophy after swimming exercise, indicating an essential role of AKT activation in exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy.116 More recently, the transcription factor Forkhead box class O1 FoxO1 was found to be required for exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy, but was not necessary in mediating PI3K activation-induced physiological hypertrophy in vivo.117 swimming exercise The IGF1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was not only investigated at baseline and in exercise-induced cardiac growth, but also explored in CVD with exercise intervention. Swimming exercise and cardiac-speciﬁc caPI3K overexpression had similar protective effects in a transgenic model of dilated cardiomyopathy DCM.118 Exercise-induced activation of PI3K and AKT was shown to inhibit pathological stimulus-induced G protein-coupled receptor GPCR activation and its downstream MAPK activation such as extra- cellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1/2, thus inhibiting patholo- gical hypertrophy.118 Regular training prevented aortic banding-induced pathological cardiac hypertro- phy, however, the protective effect of exercise was attenuated in banded cardiac-speciﬁc dnPI3K TG mice.119 On the contrary, cardiac-speciﬁc caPI3K expression was protective against patho- logical cardiac hypertrophy.119 These data suggest that PI3K is necessary for exercise-induced cardioprotection. The PI3K and/or AKT activation exhibits cardioprotective effects through promot- ing cardiomyocyte contractility, enhancing survival while inhibit- ing apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, and promoting angiogenesis, contributing further to exercise-induced cardioprotection.120–123 RNA sequencing and miRNA array revealed a group of mRNAs and miRNAs that were regulated in cardiac-speciﬁc caPI3K or dnPI3K TG mice, which can provide important information for further identifying downstream targets of the IGF1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in response to exercise.124 C/EBPβ/CITED4 signaling pathway The C/EBPβ belongs to the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein gene family which also includes C/EBPα, C/EBPδ, C/EBPε, C/EBPɣ, and C/ EBPζ. The C/EBP family members share highly conserved basic- leucine zipper bZIP domain at the C-terminus which consists of basic amino-acid-rich DNA-binding region followed by leucine zipper, but differ a lot in sequence at the N-terminus.125 The Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022 7:306 Exercise training maintains cardiovascular health: signaling pathways. . .

Exercise leads to downregulation of the transcription factor C/EBPβ which is associated with increased AKT activity in the heart. The C/EBPβ interacts with SRF binding to the promoters of cardiac genes e.g., GATA4 and α-MHC and CITED4, leading to a negative transcriptional regulation of these genes. Increased CITED4 can act as a regulator of mTOR signaling with increased phosphorylation of p70S6K, ULK1/2, and 4E-BP, which mediates the beneﬁcial effects of CITED4 in promoting physiological cardiac hypertrophy and preventing cardiac I/R injury. Increasing CITED4 is also able to prevent pathological hypertrophy through activating the mTOR pathway and upregulating anti-ﬁbrotic miR-30d. C/EBPβ CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β, SRF serum response factor, CITED4 CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich carboxyterminal domain 4, α-MHC α-myosin heavy chain, mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin, AKT protein kinase B, miR microRNA, LV left ventricle, CM cardiomyocyte, I/R ischemia-reperfusion C/EBPs act as important transcription factors, through forming either the homodimers or heterodimers with intrafamilial mem- bers or the heterodimers with other transcription factors contain- ing bZIP domain or not, thus binding to speciﬁc gene promoters and regulating gene transcriptions.126 The C/EBPs have been well known for their pivotal roles in regulating many cell processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation.127 In recent years, increasing evidence has indicated that the C/ EBPβ and its downstream target CBP/p300-interacting transacti- vator with ED-rich carboxyterminal domain 4 CITED4 are essentially involved in exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy, and targeting the C/EBPβ/CITED4 signaling pathway is effective to prevent pathological cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial I/R injury Fig. 3. Using RT-PCR-based screening against all transcriptional components, it has been identiﬁed that exercise training can downregulate C/EBPβ, while increasing CITED4 expression in the heart.49 Reducing C/EBPβ was sufﬁcient to mimic exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophic phenotype as evidenced by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and proliferation.49 Meanwhile, reducing C/EBPβ promoted hyper- trophic cell growth and proliferation of primary cardiomyocytes.49 C/EBPβ was further shown to interact with the transcription factor serum response factor SRF binding to the promoters of cardiac genes such as GATA4, α-MHC, and CITED4, thus leading to a negative transcriptional regulation of these genes; these genes also promoted hypertrophy and/or proliferation of primary cardiomyocytes.49 In addition to phenocopying the physiological cardiac growth, reducing C/EBPβ also protected against transaor- tic constriction TAC-induced pathological hypertrophy in mice.49 Cardiomyocyte-speciﬁc CITED4 expression was found to induce an increase in heart weight and cardiomyocyte size, while did not stimulate signiﬁcant cardiomyocyte proliferation in the heart.128 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022 7:306 Moreover, cardiac-speciﬁc CITED4 TG mice were resistant to cardiac I/R injury as evidenced by improved cardiac function, survival, and reduced cardiac ﬁbrosis in the remodeling phase.128 Molecular analysis further revealed that CITED4 acted as a regulator of mTOR signaling leading to the activation of mTOR Complex 1 mTORC1 including increased phosphorylation of p70S6K, ULK1/2, and 4E-BP, which mediated the effects of CITED4 in promoting cardiomyocyte growth in size and proliferation and in preventing cardiac I/R injury.128 On the contrary, cardiac-speciﬁc CITED4 KO mice had maladaptive cardiac responses to exercise as evidenced by ventricular dilation, reduced cardiac function, and upregulated pathological and ﬁbrosis-associated genes.129 More- over, cardiac-speciﬁc CITED4 KO mice manifested aggravated pathological hypertrophy, cardiac ﬁbrosis, and cardiac dysfunction in TAC-induced pathological hypertrophy.129 Collectively, these data suggest that reduction of CITED4 causes deleterious effects in both physiological and pathological hypertrophy, which was found to be associated with impaired mitochondrial pathways, reduced mTORC1 activity, and downregulated anti-ﬁbrotic miR- 30d.129 Interestingly, C/EBPβ was negatively regulated by AKT activity in cardiomyocytes and contributed to AKT-regulated gene expression as seen with exercise training, which acts as connec- tion between the C/EBPβ/CITED4 signaling and the IGF1/PI3K/AKT pathway in exercised-heart.49 PPAR, PGC1α, AMPK signaling network Exercise training efﬁciently induces mitochondria and energy metabolic changes to meet the increased demand of oxygen and energy in the heart. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α PPARα, being part of the ligand-activated nuclear receptor superfamily, is highly expressed in cardiac myocytes and can be activated by exercise.130 Compared to PPARα, PPARγ is Exercise training maintains cardiovascular health: signaling pathways. . .

Exercise triggers an increase in NO production, Ca2+-Calmodulin kinase interaction, and AMPK activation, leading to PGC1α upregulation and activation in cardiac muscle cells. The PGC1α may form transcriptional regulatory complex with PPARα and RXR, or coactivate other transcriptional partners such as NRF-1/2 and ERR, to promote downstream transcription of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis/energy metabolism, respectively. Exercise-induced AMPK may modulate glucose uptake, glycolysis and glucose oxidation, and may modulate fatty acid utilization including fatty acid uptake, translocation to mitochondrial, and fatty acid oxidation as well.

The PGC1α, acting as an important transcriptional coactivator, can interact with other transcription factors and regulate target gene transcription. It has been recognized that exercise training triggers an increase in NO production, Ca2+-calmodulin kinase interaction, and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase AMPK activation, which leads to PGC1α upregulation and activation in both skeletal and cardiac muscle cells.135–138 The PGC1α is a central transcriptional coactivator that links physiolo- gical exercise stimulus and metabolic changes in the heart Fig. 4. The PGC1α/PPARα/RXR transcriptional regulatory complex pro- motes downstream transcription of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation pathway.139 In addition to regulating fatty acid metabolism, PGC1α is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism.139 The PGC1α can coactivate other transcriptional partners, such as nuclear respiratory factor-1 and 2 NRF-1/2 and estrogen-related receptor ERR which activates transcription of the genes involved in mitochondrial transcription biogenesis e.g., nuclear-encoded mitochondrial factor A, Tfam and energy metabolism including tricarboxylic acid TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.140,141 In addition, PGC1α can be activated by AMPK upon exercise training. AMPK is a serine/threonine kinase that can be activated by exercise stimulus associated with a decreased ATP/AMP ratio.142,143 The increased AMPK phosphorylation at Thr172 promotes glucose transport and glycolysis by regulating GLUT4 translocation to cell membrane in myocardium and skeletal muscle and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase PFK2.144,145 AMPK may also modulate fatty acid uptake, translocation to the mitochon- drial, and fatty acid oxidation through regulating acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACC, CD36, and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase MCD.144,146 AMPK, through activating PGC1α, also contributes to mitochondrial biogenesis.147 Increasing evidence has demonstrated the protective effect of exercise against myocardial injuries through regulating the metabolic pathways. A 3-week swimming exercise regimen was shown to be protective and attenuate acute myocardial I/R injury in mice via the upregulation of PPARα, PPARγ, and PGC1α and regulation of the involved in fatty acid and glucose metabolism and genes mitochondrial biogenesis.87 Moreover, a 15-week treadmill running regimen was effective in preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy in db/ db mice and was associated with improved mitochondrial biogenesis and activated PGC1α.148 In a streptozotocin/high-fat diet mouse model of diabetic cardiomyopathy, treadmill running also attenuated diabetic cardiomyopathy at least in part through improving PGC1α- and AMPK-dependent mitochondrial function.149 Thus, the PPAR, PGC1α, and AMPK signaling forms a complex network mediating the cardiac metabolic changes in response to exercise and contributes to exercise-induced cardioprotective effects.

Exercise can activate the eNOS/NO signaling pathway through either calcium-dependent or -independent ways. Exercise-induced shear stress leads to an increase of intracellular Ca2+ within endothelial cells, which then interacts with calmodulin and activates eNOS and NO generation. Exercise can also activate the PI3K/AKT, AMPK, and PKA signaling pathways and subsequently increase eNOS phosphorylation and NO generation. The NO promotes angiogenesis or diffuses into adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells or cardiac muscle cells to induce cGMP-dependent relaxation. In cardiac muscle cells, exercise promotes the association of eNOS to the mitochondrial membrane, leading to increased NO bioavailability and S-nitrosylation of proteins involved in mitochondrial respiratory function, electron transport, and mPTP opening. The NO can further inhibit ROS and Ca2+ interaction in the mitochondria and then protect cardiomyocytes from cell death. Meanwhile, the eNOS located in the caveolae within cardiac myocytes can also be activated by exercise-associated myocardial stress to facilitate the opening of sarcoplasmic reticulum RyR2. eNOS endothelial nitric oxide synthase, NO nitric oxide, NE norepinephrine, β3-AR β3-adrenoceptor, VEGFR vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, PI3K phosphoinositide-3 kinase, AKT protein kinase B, AMPK adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, GPCR G protein-coupled receptor, AC adenylate cyclase, PKA protein kinase A, sGC soluble guanylyl cyclase, cGMP cyclic guanosine monophosphate, SNO N-nitrosylation, ROS reactive oxygen species, mPTP mitochondrial permeability transition pore, c cytochrome c, ER endoplasmic reticulum, RyR2 reticulum ryanodine receptor type 2 eNOS/NO signaling pathway Modulation of the eNOS/NO signaling contributes to exercise- induced vascular adaptations and cardioprotective effects Fig. 5. Exercise-induced vascular shear stress is an efﬁcient stimulus to increase intracellular Ca2+.150 The intracellular Ca2+, through interacting with calmodulin, leads to the dissociation of eNOS from caveolin and then activates eNOS to generate NO from L-Arginine in endothelial cells.55 Apart from the calcium- dependent eNOS activation, exercise also stimulates hormone and growth factor secretions such as norepinephrine NE and vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF, which may bind to β3- AR and VEGFR in endothelial cells and further activate PI3K/AKT signaling and subsequent eNOS phosphorylation.151,152 Exercise- induced activation of β3-AR was shown to be necessary to activate eNOS phosphorylation and NO generation in the heart that was I/R injury.153 In addition, exercise protective against myocardial can lead to eNOS phosphorylation through protein kinase A PKA and AMPK.154,155 The phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177, Ser 615, and/or Ser633 leads to an increase in eNOS activity and NO production.151,156,157 Furthermore, exercise-induced myocardial stretch can activate eNOS that is located in the caveolae within cardiac myocytes, which then facilitates the opening of sarco- plasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor type 2 RyR2.158 Exercise-induced NO in endothelial cells will diffuse into vascular smooth muscle cells, where it activates soluble guanylyl cyclase sGC to induce catalytic conversion of GTP to cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP; the latter will further activate protein kinase G PKG and lead to relaxation of smooth muscle Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022 7:306 cells.159,160 The eNOS can be expressed in both coronary endothelium and cardiomyocytes in the heart, with the majority being in endothelial cells.161 Recent studies have shown that exercise increases eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 and protein S-nitrosylation mainly in endothelial cells but not in cardiomyo- cytes.57 The isolated segments of left coronary arteries from exercised rats showed enhanced endothelium-dependent vasor- in vitro, and the I/R-induced elaxation to acetylcholine Ach alterations in endothelium-dependent vasodilation was also improved in the coronary artery segments isolated from exercised group.57 While the protective effect of exercise against myocardial I/R injury was attenuated in endothelium-inactivated rats, suggesting an essential contribution of coronary endothelium to exercise-induced cardioprotective effects.57 A paracrine effect of diffused NO into cardiomyocytes may also protect the myocar- dium from I/R injury with reduced lactate dehydrogenase LDH activity.162 In addition, it was reported that exercise can increase the association of eNOS with the mitochondria within the cardiac myocytes, thus increasing the bioavailability of NO and subse- quent S-nitrosylation of the proteins involved in mitochondrial respiratory function, electron transport, and mPTP opening.42 The increased NO bioavailability in mitochondria has also the potential to blunt the interplay between ROS production and Ca2+ overload and then protect cardiomyocytes from cell death.42 Exercise-induced activation of the eNOS/NO pathway also exerts cardiovascular protective effects through modulating angiogenesis.163,164 The aging-related reduction of capillary density in the heart was improved by 8 weeks of swimming Exercise training maintains cardiovascular health: signaling pathways. . . Chen et al. exercise in old rats, which was attributed to the increased VEGF angiogenic signaling cascade and subsequent phosphorylation of AKT and eNOS.165 Regular exercise training can upregulate miR- PI3KR2, a negative regulator of PI3K activity, thus leading to an activation of PI3K/AKT/eNOS signaling that mediates the angio- genetic effect of miR-126 in exercised heart.166 MiR-126 also downregulates the target gene Sprouty-related protein 1 SPRED1 which then activates the Raf-1/ERK1/2 signaling contributing to angiogenesis.166 Exercise has been shown to trigger an upregula- tion of HIF1α that acts as an upstream regulator of miR-126, which then targets PI3KR2 and SPRED1 and promotes angiogenesis through activating PI3K/AKT/eNOS signaling in myocardial infarc- tion rats.167 Exercise training has also been known to increase spleen-derived and circulating endothelial progenitor cells EPCs via eNOS and VEGF upregulation, which prevents carotid artery injury through promoting angiogenesis.168 Collectively, the eNOS/ NO signaling pathway mediates cardioprotective effects through acting on different types of cells, including endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, and smooth muscle cells. To deﬁne the cardioprotective effects of different types of exercise training attributed to the eNOS/NO signaling pathway, further investiga- tion is required. Noncoding RNAs and their regulated signaling pathways Noncoding RNAs are key epigenetic regulators of gene expression that account for the regulation of cell homeostasis and control a wide range of diseases.169,170 With the development of next- generation sequencing technologies, different types of noncoding RNAs, such as microRNA miRNA, long-noncoding RNA lncRNA, and circular RNA circRNA, have been increasingly identiﬁed and explored in different cardiovascular physiological and pathophy- siological processes.171–175 Exercise training was effective to induce miR-29a/c expression in the heart which was associated with downregulated collagen gene expressions.176 Some other noncoding RNAs and their potential downstream targets were identiﬁed and proposed in the heart in response to exercise training, such as miR-1 and miR-214 targeting NCX and SERCA2a,177 miR-27a/b and miR-143 targeting angiotensin- converting enzyme-Angiotensin II genes,178 miR-208a/b target- ing Med13, Purβ, Sox6, HP1β, and SP3, and miR-21, miR-144, miR- 145, miR-124 targeting PI3K/AKT signaling.179 The noncoding RNAs that have been found regulated in exercised heart may have functional roles in mediating exercise- induced cardioprotective effects Fig. 6. Exercise-induced upre- gulation of miR-126 promoted angiogenesis and protected the heart from myocardial I/R injury and myocardial infarction through targeting PI3KR2 and SPRED1.166,167 Muscle-enriched miR-486 was induced by exercise and was necessary to mediate the beneﬁcial effect of exercise in reducing I/R injury and myocardial apoptosis through targeting PTEN and FoxO1.180 However, circulating extracellular vesicles depleted of miR-486 lose their protective effect against cardiomyocyte apoptosis.181 LncRNA Mhrt779 was upregulated after 3 weeks of swimming exercise and continued to increase even at 1 week after swimming cessation; increased Mhrt779 was responsible for the beneﬁcial effect of exercise hypertrophic preconditioning that prevented pathological cardiac hypertrophy, through binding to Brg1 and regulating the histone deacetylase 2 HDAC2/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3β GSK3β signaling pathway.182 Exercise training leads to upregulation of ADAR2, a member of the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA, which converts adenosine to inosine A to I.37 Exercise-induced Exercise miR-17-3p lncRNA CPhar miR-222 LncExACT1 lncRNA Mhrt779 TIMP3 DDX 17 C/EBPβ p27 HMBOX1 HIPK1/2 miR-222 Hdac2 Brg1 ADAR2 miR-34a Sirt1 CyclinD1 Bcl2 sEV from endothelial cells miR-342-5p EGFR JNK SP-1 AKT Cardiomyocyte Nucleus AKT/GSK3β miR-486 miR-126 Ppm1f Caspase9 JNK2 sEV from brown adipose tissue CM pathological hypertrophy CM apoptosis CM proliferation AKT ATF7 transcription C/EBPβ C/EBPβ LncExACT1 DCHS2 transcription FoxO1 PI3KR2 SPRED1 Promoter DCHS2 promoter region P MST1/2 AKT/mTOR CM apoptosis PI3K/AKT/eNOS YAP Targets CM apoptosis Angiogenesis miR-125b-5p miR-128-3p miR-30d-5p CM apoptosis Physiological hypertrophy miR-17-3p, miR-222, lncRNA CPhar, lncExACT1 Pathological hypertrophy lncExACT1, lncRNA Mhrt779 Myocardial I/R injury miR-222, miR-17-3p, miR-486 lncRNA CPhar, lncExACT1, Myocardial infarction or Doxorubicin- induced cardiomyopathy miR-126, ADAR2 sEV-miR-342-5p, sEV-miR-125-5p/ miR-128-3p/ miR-30d-5p Fig. 6 Noncoding RNAs and their regulated pathways in exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy and cardioprotection. Exercise upregulates miR-222 targeting p27, Hmbox1, HIPK1/2 and miR-17-3p targeting PTEN and TIMP3 in the heart. Exercise also upregulates lncRNA CPhar while downregulates lncExACT1 in the heart. LncRNA CPhar acts as a binding partner of DDX17 which sequesters C/EBPβ, thus leading to reduced transcription of ATF7. LncExACT1 is able to bind miR-222, while exercise-induced downregulation of lncExACT1 frees more miR-222 which contributes to exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy. LncExACT1 also positively regulates its closest protein- coding gene DCHS2 and reduced lncExACT1 activates YAP. Targeting these noncoding RNAs contributes to exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy and exerts protective effects against myocardial I/R injury and pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Exercise also regulates other noncoding RNAs including lncRNA Mhrt779, miR-486, ADAR2-regualted miR-34a, and miR-126, and induces endothelial cell-derived small extracellular vesicles sEV containing miR-342-5p and brown adipose tissue-derived sEV containing miR-125b-5p, miR-128-3p, and miR- 30d-5p in the heart, which protect against myocardial injury and cardiac remodeling Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022 7:306 the same time, ADAR2 was revealed to negatively regulate miR-34a through A to I editing of pri-miR-34a.37 Increasing ADAR2 or inhibiting miR-34a inhibited promoted the proliferation and at apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, without inﬂuencing cardiomyocyte size.37 Notably, increasing ADAR2 was able to prevent myocardial infarction or doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy through down- regulating miR-34a and modulating its target genes Sirt1, Cyclin D1, and Bcl2.37 Interestingly, the key transcription factor C/EBPβ regulated by exercise could bind to the promoter region of ADAR2 and negatively regulate its expression.37 It has been well-established that exercise can also modulate the circulating noncoding RNAs and extracellular vesicle-associated noncoding RNAs which may in turn, inﬂuence the development of CVD or serve as potential biomarkers for exercise adaptations and CVD.183–185 Exercise-induced exosomal miR-342-5p mainly derived from the endothelial cells conveyed cardioprotective effect against myocardial I/R injury through targeting Caspase 9, Jnk2, and Ppm1f, which reduced apoptosis while promoted survival of cardiomyocytes.26 Exercise also induced brown adipose tissue- derived small EVs containing a group of miRNAs miR-125b-5p, miR-128-3p, and miR-30d-5p, which protected against myocardial I/R injury through targeting the molecules e.g., MAP3K5, MAP2K7, involved in the pro-apoptotic MAPK signaling AND MAP2K4 pathway.25 These studies indicate that extracardiac tissue-derived EVs and their contained cargos may serve as alternative candidates to mediate exercise-associated cardioprotection. In recent years, some noncoding RNAs that contribute to exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy have been shown to exert protective effects against myocardial I/R injury and cardiac remodeling.46,47,51,186 MiRNAs are a large group of highly conserved small noncoding RNAs of 18 to 25 nucleotide long, which negatively regulate downstream target genes by inducing transcript degradation or inhibiting protein translation.187 Based on miRNA array and RT-qPCR, miR-222 was identiﬁed to be upregulated in the heart in both swimming and voluntary wheel running exercise models.47 Although cardiomyocyte-speciﬁc increase of miR-222 was not sufﬁcient to recapitulate the exercised heart phenotype, reducing miR-222 markedly attenu- ated exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy in vivo.47 MiR-222 promoted the physiological growth in size and prolifera- tion, while inhibited apoptosis of primary cardiomyocytes.47 Interestingly, cardiac-speciﬁc expression of miR-222 was effective reduce to increase proliferation markers of cardiomyocytes, myocardial apoptosis, and prevent cardiac remodeling and dysfunction after I/R injury.47 The P27, Hmbox1, and HIPK1/2 were identiﬁed as target genes of miR-222.47 The serine/threonine protein kinase HIPK2 was further demonstrated to be upregulated in exercised heart.188 Interestingly, HIPK2 knockout or HIPK2 inhibitor, and miR-222 overexpression were found to be protective against myocardial infarction in mice.188 Mechanistically, inhibit- ing HIPK2 reduced apoptosis of primary cardiomyocytes and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes hESC-CMs through inhibiting P53.188 Since increasing miR-222 alone was not sufﬁcient to induce physiological cardiac hypertrophy, other noncoding RNAs may have the potential to contribute to exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy. MiR-17-3p was further identiﬁed as a key miRNA that mediates exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy and protects the heart from I/ R injury through targeting TIMP3 and PTEN.186 Indeed, noncoding RNAs that contribute to exercise-induced physiological hypertro- phy may be potential targets to mitigate pathological hypertro- phy.54 Exercise-regulated molecules including noncoding RNAs may regulate multiple pathways and mechanisms pro-hypertro- phy, pro-proliferation, anti-apoptosis that converge in conferring cardiovascular protective effects.22 LncRNAs are a heterogenous group of noncoding RNAs whose transcript size is more than 200 nucleotides.189 LncRNAs can be thus regulating gene located in the nucleus or cytoplasm, Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022 7:306 Exercise training maintains cardiovascular health: signaling pathways. . . Chen et al. expressions and chromatin status in cis or in trans, modulating nuclear structure and organization, and interacting with numerous proteins and/or RNA molecules.189 A growing number of lncRNAs has been unraveled to play pivotal roles in myocardial injury and CVD such as pathological cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, cardiac ﬁbrosis, and heart failure.190 Recently, lncRNAs were shown to contribute to exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy and cardioprotective effects.189 Based on lncRNA microarray, lncRNA CPhar was found to be markedly upregulated in the hearts of swimming exercised mice, while downregulated in TAC-induced pathological cardiac hypertro- phy.51 CPhar had pro-hypertrophic, pro-proliferative, and anti- apoptotic effects in primary cardiomyocytes in vitro, and was necessary to mediate exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy in vivo.51 Moreover, increasing CPhar was protective against myocardial I/R injury and cardiac dysfunction in mice.51 CPhar acts as a binding partner of DDX17 which sequesters C/ EBPβ, a key transcription factor involved in exercise-induced thus leading to reduced physiological cardiac hypertrophy, transcription of ATF7.51 More recently, lncRNA lncExACT1 was identiﬁed to be decreased in exercised heart while increased in pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.46 Of note, increasing lncExACT1 induced pathological hypertrophy, while reducing lncExACT1 induced physiological hypertrophy pheno- types seen with exercise training myocardial hypertrophy, increased proliferation markers of cardiomyocytes and improved cardiac function in vivo.46 LncExACT1 is able to bind miR-222, lncExACT1 releases while exercise-induced downregulation of more miR-222 which in turn contributes to exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy.46 LncExACT1 also positively regulates its closest protein-coding gene DCHS2 and reduced lncExACT1 activates YAP, which mediates the effect of lncExACT1 on cardiomyocyte growth and proliferation.46 Moreover, modulat- ing DCHS2 was sufﬁcient to regulate physiological and patholo- gical cardiac hypertrophy in vivo.46 These studies reinforce the message that lncRNAs and their regulated signaling pathways involved in exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy may be potential therapeutic targets for CVD.191 It has been widely accepted that exercise is medicine and may serve as the real polypill to prevent and treat a variety of diseases including CVD.192 Physical inactivity is associated with 30% of ischemic heart disease burden, while exercise has protective effects in reducing cardiovascular risk factors and major cardio- vascular events. For example, dynamic endurance exercise showed similar effect in reducing total cholesterol and low- density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol when compared to drug interventions.193 For those who can exercise appropriately, exercise is one of the most cost-effective interventions for cardiovascular health. However, for those who cannot exercise efﬁciently, exercise mimetics which speciﬁcally mimic some aspects of exercise-induced cardiovascular responses will alter- natively bring about beneﬁcial effects.194 The increasing knowledge of exercise-regulated signaling pathways will lead to the investigation of potential therapeutic targets and strategies that have protective effects against CVD in experimental models. Numerous studies have shown that activat- ing the IGF1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway has beneﬁcial effects in a wide range of CVD such as myocardial infarction, myocardial I/R injury, diabetic cardiomyopathy, atrial ﬁbrillation, and heart failure.124,195–198 These studies have used global or cardiac- speciﬁc genetically modiﬁed murine models targeting IGF1R, PI3K, and AKT.107–110,116 However, most of the genetically modiﬁed animals have undergone regulated gene expression or activity before the onset of CVD, indicating that the cardiovascular Exercise training maintains cardiovascular health: signaling pathways. . . Chen et al. protective effects were predominately preventive. On the other hand, long-term activation of the IGF1/PI3K/AKT pathway may have detrimental effects, causing pathological cardiac hypertro- phy or increasing the tumorigenesis risk, especially for the global genetically modiﬁed animal models.199–201 Although some phar- macological approaches using IGF1 have shown protective effects against cardiac injury and dysfunction in animal experimental studies,202,203 clinical trials reported that chronic administration of IGF1 to human participants did not confer signiﬁcant cardiopro- tective effects and may even cause cardiac ﬁbrosis.204 Thus, other strategies that may activate the IGF1/PI3K/AKT in the heart require further investigation.205–207 Gene therapy targeting PI3K may also be potential strategy for protecting against cardiac remodeling in diabetic cardiomyopathy and in pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy model as well.119,208 In addition to the IGF1/PI3K/AKT pathway, other signaling molecules have been studied in the exercised heart. The use of inducible, cardiac- speciﬁc genetically modiﬁed animal models facilitates the func- tional studies of speciﬁc exercise-regulated molecules and the investigation of the onset of CVD.128,129 therapeutic effects after their system due to their Gene therapy has been widely used in animal experimental models of CVD.209 Different viral vectors are available for delivering targeted genes in vivo. Adenovirus-based gene delivery has robust transgene expression and high transduction rate, however, its application may be limited by its short-term effect and non-speciﬁc gene delivery. The lentivirus vector facilitates long-term gene expression in vivo at the expense of genomic integration. In comparison, the adeno-associated viruses AAVs are promising vectors for both long-term and tissue/cell-speciﬁc gene expressions.210 Among different AAV serotypes, AAV9 and AAV6 vectors are mostly used for gene expression in the study of cardiotropism advan- cardiovascular tage.208,211,212 The AAV9 or AAV6 mediated gene expression with a cardiac muscle cell-speciﬁc promoter such as α-myosin heavy chain α-MHC and cardiac Troponin T cTnT will further enhance the cardiotropic delivery.213 AAV-mediated gene therapy and its implications in CVD has been reviewed in detail previously.209,214 In a murine model of diabetic cardiomyopathy, a single tail vein injection of recombinant AAV6 rAAV6-caPI3K gene therapy was efﬁcient to attenuate myocardial hypertrophy, cardiac ﬁbrosis, and cardiac dysfunction.208 The delivery of rAAV6-caPI3K was applied after the manifestation of diabetic cardiomyopathy, suggesting a therapeutic potential of activating PI3K in the treatment of cardiac remodeling in diabetes.208 In another murine model of myocardial I/R injury, a therapeutic delivery of AAV9-miR-486 within 30 min after I/R injury showed beneﬁcial effect in reducing myocardial apoptosis, cardiac remodeling, and cardiac dysfunction at both acute and chronic injury phase.180 The upregulation of miR-486 in the heart was found to be persistent even after 7 weeks post injection.180 For targeting exercise-regulated lncRNA CPhar, a tail vein injection of AAV9-short hairpin sh-CPhar attenuated exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy, while injec- tion of AAV9-CPhar was protective against cardiac remodeling at I/R injury.51 The long-term gene expression has also been observed with AAV9-lncExACT1 driven by a cardiac-speciﬁc troponin promoter showing upregulated injection which induced lncExACT1 even at 16 weeks post pathological cardiac hypertrophy.46 Despite the growing progress in AAV-mediated cardiac gene therapy, challenges remain to overcome host neutralizing anti-AAV antibodies, AAV delivery methods, and large-scale manufacture of AAV which will facilitate AAV cardiac gene therapy in large animal models and promote the translation to clinical application in the future.210 In addition, oligonucleotide-based gene therapy using miR mimic or agomiR, noncoding RNA inhibitors antisense oligonu- cleotides, locked nucleic acid, antagomiR, small interfering RNA, and modiﬁed RNA, has also been applied to regulate gene expressions in vivo. These oligonucleotides can be commercially synthetized and are easy to dose in vivo.214 To investigate the effect of reducing lncExACT1 in physiological cardiac hypertrophy and in the protection against cardiac remodeling, a tail vein injection of the LNA antisense oligonucleotide GapmeR speciﬁc to lncExACT1 led to reduced lncExACT1 expression which induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy and protected against cardiac remodeling and heart failure.46 Currently, the viral vector- and oligonucleotide-based gene therapies are recognized as prosper- ous therapeutic strategies explored in pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials.215 Nonetheless, gene therapy is still in infancy and further investigation of efﬁcacy and safety is required for those targets that have shown promising experimental results in the treatment of CVD. Since exercise training can modify the number and cargo of extracellular vesicles which could partly mediate exercise’s beneﬁts for the cardiovascular health, extracellular vesicle-based therapies prompt In addition, exercise-regulated microbiota and related metabolites could be applicated to protect against myocardial infarction.101 A schematic diagram of the potential therapeutic strategies based on exercise- regulated signaling pathways is presented in Fig. 7. investigation.25,26,97,181 further The current knowledge and optimal design of animal exercise studies have been reviewed in detail previously which is of great importance to guide high quality-controlled animal exercise studies that will lead to a deeper understanding of exercise- associated cardioprotection.21,216 It is noteworthy that there are multiple factors that may inﬂuence the adaptations and outcomes of exercise. Genetic background In animal experimental exercise studies, genetic background or molecular modiﬁcations may cause impaired exercise capacity.217 An increase of citrate synthase activity upon exercise as measured in mixed skeletal muscles including tibialis anterior and gastro- cnemius helps to compare whether the animals had comparable exercise capacity among different groups.110 Also, whether genetic differences of human individuals inﬂuence their exercise habitude or cardiovascular responses upon exercise remain to be clariﬁed. Sex difference Sex difference may also inﬂuence the effect of exercise.218 It has been demonstrated that female mice developed greater increase in physiological myocardial hypertrophy after treadmill or voluntary wheel running.219 Moreover, although both male and female mice showed an increase in left ventricular mass after treadmill running, male and female mice had different regulation in Akt and MAPK signaling pathways in response to exercise.220 Further study is required to determine sex-speciﬁc signaling pathway responses upon exercise.221 Exercise protocol or program The exercise modality, intensity, frequency, and duration need to be further studied in both animal exercise models and clinical cohort studies.222 Currently, treadmill running, wheel running, and swimming exercise are the most widely used animal exercise models in the study of CVD, facilitating the standardization, comparison, and promotion of exercise studies from different research groups worldwide.21,216 However, exercise intensity and frequency such as interval high-intensity treadmill running versus moderate-intensity continuous treadmill running can have differ- ent cardiovascular responses by differentially regulating signaling pathways.223 It has been reported that high-intensity exercise in Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022 7:306 Exercise training maintains cardiovascular health: signaling pathways. . .

Meanwhile, exercise-regulated small extracellular vesicles and gut microbiota as well as related metabolites can be applied to be potential therapeutic strategies for myocardial injury.

For humans, the World Health Organization 2020 guidelines recommended that all adults should undertake 150–300 min of moderate-intensity or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week.16 However, for CVD patients, low-to-moderate intensity of aerobic exercise is recommended to stable patients with NYHA class I-III; low intensity 40% of VO2peak is recommended in NYHA class III patients.224,225 Resistance training can be implemented after of muscle strength test. However, the indications can vary and be modiﬁed according to the functional class of patients which depend on cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 6-min walk test, echocardiography, and biochemical analyses by the doctors. In addition to different exercise training protocols or programs, the molecules and signaling pathways that are regulated by exercise may have the value to reﬂect the effect of exercise in cardiovascular healthy in humans. As the key regulators of exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy, miR-222 and miR-17–3p were found to be markedly upregulated in serum from failure patients after a cardiopulmonary exercise test- heart ing.47,186 Compared to healthy controls, serum level of miR-222 was signiﬁcantly lower in patients with myocardial infarction at hospitalization.188 Moreover, lower miR-222 level was associated with rehospitalization or death during 1-year follow-up in these patients, serving as a potential biomarker for poor prognosis of myocardial infarction.188 Indeed, it is worth exploring the values of exercise-regulated molecules such as noncoding RNAs serving as potential biomarkers that can indicate exercise efﬁciency or CVD prognosis. Exercise intolerance Exercise intolerance is a crucial problem in patients with heart failure, which is a hallmark of poor prognosis. Among the different methods used to assess exercise and functional capacity e.g., NYHA functional classiﬁcation, 6-min walk test, graded exercise testing with electrocardiography ECG, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing is golden standard. Exercise intolerance in patients with heart failure can be attributed not only to reduced cardiac reserve and pulmonary reserve, but also to skeletal muscle dysfunction and other factors such as peripheral vascular dysfunction, obesity, and nutritional factors.226 Thus, in addition to the beneﬁcial effect of exercise to the myocardium, it is also important to elucidate the function and underlying mechanism of exercise in the extracardiac tissues and organs. For example, pathological cardiac stress usually causes cardiac hypertrophy but leads to atrophy of skeletal muscles. Heart failure also induces mitochondria dysfunction of skeletal muscles.227 While exercise increases myoﬁbrillar protein synthesis and the number of satellite cells and myonuclei, and increases capillary density and mitochondrial network in skeletal muscles as well. Endurance exercise leads to a switch to oxidative muscle ﬁbers type I, while resistance exercise leads to a switch to glycolytic muscle ﬁbers type II and induces robust muscle hypertrophy.228 The Akt/mTOR, AMPK, PGC1α, and Ca2+/calmo- dulin-dependent protein kinase signaling pathways are involved in exercise-induced hypertrophy and mitochondrial adaptations of skeletal muscle.228 In addition to the skeletal muscle, the beneﬁcial effect of exercise on other peripheral factors such as peripheral vascular dysfunction, obesity, and nutritional factors It is important to recognize that deserve further investigation. distinct causes and comorbid conditions may coexist which contribute to the pathophysiology of exercise intolerance in patients with heart failure, a combined pharmacological and nonpharmacological intervention e.g., exercise training, diet, etc. Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 2022 7:306 Exercise training maintains cardiovascular health: signaling pathways. . . Chen et al. are required to improve exercise capacity and prognosis of patients.226 Possible adverse effects of exercise In addition to investigate the beneﬁcial effect of exercise in cardiovascular health, the safety of exercise should also be evaluated aiming to avoid any possible adverse effects caused by excessive exercise. Compared to exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy, intensive exercise training was found to induce pathological alterations in the cardiovascular system at functional, structural, and molecular levels. After 16 weeks of vigorous running, rats developed eccentric hypertrophy and ventricular dilatation, together with diastolic dysfunction and increased arrhythmia inducibility.229 Meanwhile, signiﬁcant car- diac ﬁbrosis was detected in the atriums and right ventricle but not in the left ventricle of intensively-exercised rats accompanied with increased pro-ﬁbrotic gene and protein expressions; these ﬁbrotic changes were reversible after several weeks of exercise cessation.229 Moreover, treatment with losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, was able to alleviate cardiac ﬁbrosis induced by intensive exercise.230 In humans, plasma levels of carboxyterminal propeptide of collagen type I PICP, carboxy- terminal telopeptide of collagen type I CITP, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase type I TIMP-1 were higher in veteran athletes compared to sedentary individuals, providing biochem- ical evidence of disruption of collagen equilibrium in veteran athletes.231 Indeed, in addition to cardiac morphological and functional measurements, biomarkers that can be measured easily in human blood samples are required to be identiﬁed which will be useful to predict the intolerance of exercise or the risk of adverse effect of excessive exercise in patients. Exercise training has been widely recognized as a healthy life style modiﬁcation as well as an effective non-drug therapeutic strategy for CVD. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shed light to the protective effects and mechanisms of exercise against cardiovas- cular injury.232 In addition to the preventive beneﬁts of exercise, its therapeutic effects after the onset of CVD have also been observed and established.188 An increasing number of exercise- regulated molecules and signaling pathways have been identiﬁed, which provides potential therapeutic targets for CVD. Compared to small molecule-based therapy, gene therapy such as viral vector-based therapies e.g., adenovirus, lentivirus, AAV and oligonucleotide-based therapies e.g., mRNA, miRNA mimics, antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA provide more interventional targets available that were, however, previously “undruggable” by small molecules.233 More investigation is required to evaluate the protective effect of gene therapy targeting these exercise- regulated signaling pathways and noncoding RNAs in CVD. Despite the rapid and cost-effective development, the delivery system of gene therapy needs further exploration for more speciﬁc targeting, more effective therapy, and lower immuno- genicity.233 Very importantly, the therapeutic effects based on exercise-regulated molecules and signaling pathways need to be evaluated from small animal models to large animal models, and further to be translated for treatment of CVD in humans.181 Mechanistically, the intricate communication network between other organs or lungs, gut microbiota, brown adipose tissue, etc. and the heart, as well as the effects of exercise on this cross-talk, warrants further investigation.25–27 High-throughput and multi-omics technologies and integrated analysis will be powerful tools to identify valuable exercise-responsive factors and mediators of communication between the heart and other tissues/organs.234–236 The study of the exercise-induced epigenetic modiﬁcations in special popula- tions such as CVD patients or in the elderly will also advance our skeletal muscles, tissues e.g., knowledge on exercise-induced beneﬁcial cardiovascular adapta- tions.237,238 It would also be of great importance to identify the exercise-regulated molecules as potential biomarkers for guiding a more effective and safer exercise training for CVD patients, and predicting the prognosis of patients as well. Collectively, the data presented in this review suggest that an in-depth understanding of the signaling pathways and mechanisms involved in exercise’s beneﬁts for cardiovascular health will promote the identiﬁcation and guide the development of novel therapeutic targets and strategies to combat CVD in the future.
