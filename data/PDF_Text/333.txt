Keywords: Breast cancer, Cancer‑related cognitive impairment, Cognition, Cognitive complaints, Exercise training, Physical exercise, Aerobic exercise, Strength exercise, Physical fitness Introduction The number of breast cancer survivors dealing with late effects of cancer and its treatment has increased in recent years, due to increasing incidence and survival . Among these late effects are cognitive complaints, which are reported by a large number of breast can- cer patients, particularly after chemotherapy 2, 3. In up to 60% of patients, impaired neuropsychological test performance is found, including impaired learning and memory functioning, attention, processing speed, and executive functioning . These cognitive problems are generally of mild to moderate severity , and even a moderate decline in cognitive functioning can have a sig- nificant impact on quality of life and daily activities 5, 6. Moreover, differences in cognition between chemo- therapy-treated patients and controls can be detected up to 20 years after treatment , emphasizing the need of interventions targeting these cognitive problems. Exercise training might be an effective non-pharmaco- logical intervention to reduce cognitive problems after breast cancer treatment . Whereas many interven- tions, such as cognitive rehabilitation approaches, target the consequences of cognitive decline, exercise training might affect its underlying mechanisms. Rodent studies have shown that several biological processes affected by chemotherapy improved after exercise training, in par- ticular hippocampal neurogenesis, which is important for learning and memory functioning . Additionally, exer- cise interventions might also indirectly reduce cognitive problems by targeting fatigue, an important correlate of both exercise training and cancer-related cognitive prob- lems . Favorable effects of exercise training on cognition have been repeatedly observed in other populations, such as healthy elderly and patients with mild cognitive impair- ment 11, 12. Recently, a large observational study showed positive effects of high physical activity levels before and during chemotherapy on cognitive function- ing, even 6 months after chemotherapy treatment com- pletion . In breast cancer patients, only few small n ranged between 17 and 87 exercise intervention studies have been performed after treatment. Although these studies provided preliminary support for positive effects of exercise programs on memory and other cognitive functions 14–16, sufficiently powered trials with cogni- tion as primary outcome measure are needed to establish or dismiss the role for exercise on cognition in cancer patients . In the Physical Activity and Memory PAM study, we investigated the effects of a 6-month exercise interven- tion on cognitive functioning in cognitively impaired self-reported and confirmed by tests breast cancer patients who were diagnosed and treated with chemo- therapy 2–4 years before study enrolment. Methods Design The PAM study is a multi-center randomized clinical trial comparing a 6-month exercise intervention and a control group. Data were collected between December at the University Medical Center UMC Utrecht The Netherlands before randomization and after 6 months. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Commit- tee of the UMC Utrecht, and all patients provided written informed consent. A detailed description of the PAM study design and recruitment has been published previously . Addi- tional measurements, such as neuroimaging, will be described separately. Patients Female patients, 2–4 years after stage I–III breast cancer diagnosis, were eligible for inclusion if treated with neo adjuvant chemotherapy, between 30 and 75 years old, had no evidence of disease recurrence, reported ≤ 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week, had sufficient proficiency of the Dutch language, and were willing to be randomized. Moreover, patients needed to self-report cognitive problems after cancer diagnosis, Koevoets et al. Breast Cancer Research 2022 24:36 which was confirmed by lower than expected perfor- mance on neuropsychological testing see subsection ‘recruitment and randomization’. Exclusion criteria were: contraindication for exercise participation or MRI scanning, known neurological disorders that affect cog- nition e.g., dementia, multiple sclerosis, and planned switches or stops of endocrine therapy 4 months prior to the start or during the study period. Recruitment and randomization through invitation letters Patients were recruited n = 3258 or self-registration n = 165 Fig. 1. After eli- gibility screening by phone including a semi-structured interview about self-reported cognitive complaints, 409 11.9% patients completed the online Amsterdam Cog- nition Scan ACS, to identify cognitive problems Table 1. ACS scores resulted in 11 outcomes in five dif- ferent cognitive domains. Patients performing ≥ 1 nor- mative standard deviation below average performance of healthy females aged 30–75 years, on at least two scores in different cognitive domains, were eligible for inclusion. This is an acceptable cutoff to define cognitive decline 20, 21. After baseline measurements, patients were randomly allocated 1:1 by a member of the study team to the intervention or control group using a com- puter-generated sequence ensuring blinded treatment allocation provided by the data-management department UMC Utrecht, stratified by age category 30–45, 45–60, 60–75 years and endocrine therapy yes, no. Exercise intervention The 6-month exercise intervention of 4 h/week included aerobic and strength training supervised by a physiother- apist close to the patients’ home 2 h/week and Nordic/ power walking 2 h/week, which could be carried out individually or in a group. Intensity of the program was tailored on women’s physical fitness level, based on base- line cardiopulmonary exercise testing, repetition maxi- mum strength tests and potential constraints. Intensity of the supervised program increased as the program progressed, including high-intensity interval training starting in week 10 Table 2. Approximately 1 month after the first training, the study team performed a moni- toring visit to verify protocol adherence. Intensity of Nordic/power walking was set at 55–65% of the heart rate reserve HRR; heart rate monitors were provided. Adherence to the supervised and walking sessions is reg- istered in exercise logs by the patients and monitored by the physiotherapists. Control group Patients in the control group were requested to main- tain their habitual physical activity level. A super- vised 12-week exercise program was offered after study completion. Outcomes Our primary outcome measure was the total recall score of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised HVLT-R . This face-to-face measure of memory functioning is the gold standard in neurooncological trials and part of the core battery of the ICCTF . A list of 12 words, from three semantic categories, was read three times to the patient. After each learning trial, the patient recalled as many words as possible. The sum of these learning tri- als comprised the total recall score HVLT-R total recall. Parallel versions were used for baseline and follow-up measurements. Other outcome measures for tested cognitive func- tioning included the HVLT-R delayed recall score and recognition trial HVLT-R recognition, from which the recognition discrimination index was calculated true- positives minus false-positives. Additionally, cognitive functioning was measured with an online test battery: the ACS , which was also used as a screening instrument for eligibility. All tests start with an instruction video and most tests have a practice session with feedback. The bat- tery has shown 100% feasibility with only a few resolv- able technical errors. Test–retest reliability was high the total score had a test–retest reliability of 0.83, and concurrent validity was moderately-high to high. The ACS contains tests in the following cognitive domains: learning and memory, attention and working memory, processing speed, executive functioning, and motor functioning. The outcome measures including the cor- responding test domains and traditional test equivalents are described in Table 1. Self-reported cognitive functioning was measured with specific questions of the MD Anderson Symptom Inven- tory for multiple myeloma MDASI-MM. Two questions on severity of memory and attention problems and their interference with daily functioning were included . These questions are not disease specific and can be used in other populations. Sociodemographic data age and education, employ- ment, menopausal status, and age at menopause were assessed by a self-developed questionnaire. Clinical char- acteristics were retrieved from medical records, and data on medication use including endocrine therapy were obtained during an interview. For fatigue, five subscales of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory MFI were calculated general fatigue, Koevoets et al.

Quality of Life was measured with the European Organ- isation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30. According to the manual, global health, and all functional scales including cognitive functioning, and three symptom scales fatigue, pain, and insomnia were calculated as well as a summary score, all ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores repre- senting better quality of life and functioning, and higher symptom burden 26, 27. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS . Additionally, depression severity was measured with the total score of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 PHQ-9 . Patients performed a maximal cycle cardiopulmo- nary exercise test using a ramp protocol with continu- ous breathing gas analysis and ECG monitoring. Relative maximum oxygen uptake VO2peak was calculated as an average over the final 30 s of exercise divided by body weight at baseline. Study adherence Attendance was calculated separately for the supervised exercise program and Nordic/power walking and was defined as the number of attended sessions divided by the number of sessions offered. Compliance rate for the attended supervised sessions was calculated and aver- aged across all exercises by dividing the performed exer- cise volume by the prescribed volume. Statistical analysis To detect a clinically relevant improvement in ≥ 5 words binary outcome on the HVLT-R total recall 30–33 with 82% power and a meaningful difference ≥ 1 point in self-reported complaints MDASI-MM with 90% power alpha = 0.05, a sample size of 90 patients per group was required, including a drop-out rate of 20%. First, for tested cognitive functioning impossible values and scores indicating computer/internet issues or poor understanding of test instructions e.g., a score of 0 on Wordlist Learning were removed from the database. Additionally, for tests where a higher score indicated worse performance Reaction Time, Connecting the Dots Koevoets et al. Breast Cancer Research 2022 24:36 I and II, Place the Beads and Fill the Grid, the 3.5× median absolute distance MAD method was applied , for each age category ≤ 40, 41–59, and ≥ 60 years separately, to prevent age-based bias. Moreover, the total Reaction Time score mean of approximately 30 consecu- tive trials was omitted if 30% of the trials was removed due to outliers. For primary analyses, the intention-to-treat principle was applied and based on complete case data . Cog- nition analyses were repeated with multiple imputation n = 10 for missing outcome data to prevent potential selection bias Package: MICE ; R, 2017 . Each patient’s HVLT-R total recall score recorded at 6 months was assigned a binary outcome as improvement or failure stable or declined. Post-treatment improvement in the HVLT-R total recall score ≥ 5 words in the intervention group was compared to the control group using Fisher exact test, and relative risks adjusted for stratification fac- tors were calculated with a Poisson regression analysis. All measures of tested cognitive functioning three HVLT-R and eleven ACS measures, self-reported cog- nitive functioning MDASI-MM severity and interfer- ence, physical fitness VO2peak, and patient-reported outcomes MFI, EORTC QLQ-C30, PHQ-9, and HADS were analyzed with multiple regression analyses adjusted for stratification factors and baseline scores, to assess between-group differences. As per protocol analyses, all analyses on cognitive out- comes were repeated for patients with a minimal attend- ance of 80%. Pre-specified subgroup analyses for cognitive outcomes were performed for endocrine therapy yes, no, age category 30–45, 45–60, 60–75 years, and menopausal status pre-/peri-menopausal, postmenopausal. In addi- tion, a post-hoc analysis for recently established clini- cally important fatigue scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale ≥ 39 was performed . Critical alpha value was set at 0.05 two-sided for all analyses. Analyses except multiple imputation were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 25.0.0.2 .

Follow-up data for our primary outcome measure HVLT-R total recall were obtained from 82 patients in both the intervention and control group attrition rate = 9.4%. Reasons for drop-out were: possible metastases/new benign tumor n = 5, personal circum- stances n = 5, medical reasons n = 3, or other n = 4. Drop-outs were lower educated and used more often anti-diabetic and psychotropic medication. Two-third of the intervention patients attended ≥ 80% of all exercise sessions exercise supervised by physiother- apist: 69%; Nordic/power walking: 65%, with a median attendance of 88% range 0–100%, mean = 75% ± 28. Moreover, patients had a median attendance of 46 ses- sions of the 52 offered supervised sessions. Median com- pliance to the attended supervised exercise sessions was 95% range 71–100%, mean = 93% ± 7.

Addition- ally, no between-group differences were found for other HVLT-R measures and ten of the eleven measures of the ACS Fig. 2 and Additional file 1: Table S1. Box tapping showed significant differences at follow-up, in favor of the control group B-0.63, 95% CI − 1.20; − 0.07.

For tested and self-reported cognitive measures, between 11 and 20 values were missing at follow-up. Multiple imputation resulted in insignificant differences between groups for box tapping but did not change results of the remaining tested and self-reported cogni- tive outcomes. Since a relevant difference at baseline was seen for psy- chotropic medication between groups, cognition analy- ses were repeated with this variable as covariate. This did not affect results significantly. In the per protocol analyses, including patients with ≥ 80% exercise adherence, most effect sizes of tested cognitive outcome measures remained the same or slightly increased in favor of the intervention group 12/14 of the online cognitive outcomes. However, effect sizes remained small, and no additional significant effects were found Additional file 1: Table S2.

Discussion The PAM study is the first sufficiently powered ran- domized controlled trial investigating the effects of a 6-month physical exercise intervention on cognitive function in patients with breast cancer who still had cognitive complaints and problems 2.5 years after com- pletion of treatment with chemotherapy. The exercise intervention did not affect tested cognitive function in the total population. Interestingly, a hypothesis-driven analyses indicated a beneficial effect of exercise on tested cognition in highly fatigued patients. Moreover, in the total population, significantly positive intervention effects were seen for self-reported cognitive functioning, as well as physical fitness, fatigue, QoL, and depression. These results are consistent with the roughly compara- ble study of Hartman et al. , which is the only exer- cise study with a sample size of 10 patients per group exercise group: n = 43 and with cognitive functioning as primary outcome. They did not find effects of exer- cise training on tested cognitive functioning in the total group and in patients 2 years post-surgery, but an indi- cation for a positive effect on self-reported cognitive functioning was found. Self-reported cognitive function- ing is often related to psychosocial factors . In the PAM study, we found, besides effects on self-reported cognitive functioning, favorable effects on fatigue, QoL, and depression. These exercise effects on psychosocial factors have previously been established in breast cancer patients . Cognitive problems in cancer patients are multifac- torially determined and various mechanisms exist by which cancer and cancer therapies give rise to both self- reported cognitive complaints and cognitive decline formally assessed by neuropsychological testing . Understanding the underlying causes of cognitive prob- lems is a prerequisite to develop and select the most ben- eficial clinical interventions. Our exercise intervention aimed at improving tested cognitive problems in patients who self-report cognitive complaints, by targeting one of the presumed causes of these problems, i.e., impaired hippocampal neurogenesis . Although current results did not indicate statistically significant effects of exer- cise on memory function or other cognitive functions, 11/14 cognitive measures showed changes in favor of the intervention group. Effect sizes, moreover, increased by increasing exercise attendance. This suggests potentially much smaller effects of exercise on tested cognitive functioning than we anticipated, and only a larger trial could have detected these smaller effects. It is unclear whether these small effects would be of sufficient clinical relevance. In a hypothesis-driven post hoc analysis, we found that patients who reported considerable symptoms of fatigue at baseline improved on tested cognitive func- tioning, in particular on tasks measuring learning and memory. Using a structural equation modeling frame- work, Ehlers et al. studied pathways from physical activity to fatigue to cognitive performance. They con- cluded that effects of exercise on cognitive performance may be partially explained by the influence of exercise on cancer-related symptoms, including fatigue. Both fatigue and cancer-related cognitive impairment have been asso- ciated with neuroinflammation, one of the adverse effects of cancer treatment 4, 43. Since physical activ- ity might positively affect inflammatory status 44, 45, beneficial effects of exercise on cognitive functioning in chemotherapy-exposed cancer patients are probably not exclusively driven by targeting neurogenesis in the hip- pocampus. Additionally, these observations may advo- cate to select highly fatigued patients for enrolment in future exercise intervention studies aiming at improving cognition. This would be justifiable also because these patients are expected to benefit most from an exercise intervention with respect to fatigue outcomes . A potential limitation of our study was that patients needed to improve their baseline HVLT-R Total Recall score, our primary outcome measure, by 5 words. Patients performed considerably better at this test at baseline than anticipated, requiring in some cases a near perfect performance at follow-up to show clinically rel- evant improvement. However, analyzing the HVLT-R and ACS Wordlist as continuous outcomes and defining less words as clinically relevant improvement did not show significant intervention effects as well data not shown. Furthermore, we did not adjust for multiple testing in our secondary analyses; hence, false-positive findings cannot be excluded. For instance, our significant results on box tapping in favor of the control group, which were not in line with the general pattern of study results and absent after multiple imputation, were probably a false-positive finding. Strengths of the study include our large study sample of cognitively impaired and inactive patients, and our long and intense partly supervised exercise training, includ- ing high intensity interval training 47, 48. Additionally, our patients showed good adherence to the exercise pro- gram and physical fitness improved following the exer- cise intervention. Koevoets et al. Breast Cancer Research 2022 24:36 Conclusion Our research underscores the importance of care- ful evaluation of promising interventions using ran- domized controlled trials. Behavioral interventions, such as compensatory interventions, can improve self- reported cognitive complaints, but few have the capac- ity to actually improve cognitive test performance . Our trial showed no overall benefit of physical exer- cise on tested cognitive functioning in chemotherapy- exposed breast cancer patients with cognitive problems and emphasizes the complexity surrounding physical exercise as a potent intervention. Physical exercise led to improved self-reported cognitive functioning, physi- cal fitness, fatigue, QoL, and depression. The finding that physical exercise improved tested cognitive func- tion in highly fatigued patients is a hopeful new avenue of research. Future research should focus on uncover- ing which patients benefit most from physical exercise interventions and investigate whether fatigue mediates or moderates the effect on cognitive performance.
