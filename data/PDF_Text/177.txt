Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 Open Access Functional and/or structural brain changes in response to resistance exercises and resistance training lead to cognitive improvements – a systematic review Fabian Herold1 , Alexander Törpel4, Lutz Schega4 and Notger G. Müller1,2,3 Abstract Background: During the aging process, physical capabilities e.g., muscular strength and cognitive functions e.g., memory gradually decrease. Regarding cognitive functions, substantial functional e.g., compensatory brain activity and structural changes e.g., shrinking of the hippocampus in the brain cause this decline. Notably, growing evidence points towards a relationship between cognition and measures of muscular strength and muscle mass. Based on this emerging evidence, resistance exercises and/or resistance training, which contributes to the preservation and augmentation of muscular strength and muscle mass, may trigger beneficial neurobiological processes and could be crucial for healthy aging that includes preservation of the brain and cognition. Compared with the multitude of studies that have investigated the influence of endurance exercises and/or endurance training on cognitive performance and brain structure, considerably less work has focused on the effects of resistance exercises and/or resistance training. While the available evidence regarding resistance exercise-induced changes in cognitive functions is pooled, the underlying neurobiological processes, such as functional and structural brain changes, have yet to be summarized. Hence, the purpose of this systematic review is to provide an overview of resistance exercise-induced functional and/or structural brain changes that are related to cognitive functions. Methods and results: A systematic literature search was conducted by two independent researchers across six electronic databases; 5957 records were returned, of which 18 were considered relevant and were analyzed. Short conclusion: Based on our analyses, resistance exercises and resistance training evoked substantial functional brain changes, especially in the frontal lobe, which were accompanied by improvements in executive functions. Furthermore, resistance training led to lower white matter atrophy and smaller white matter lesion volumes. However, based on the relatively small number of studies available, the findings should be interpreted cautiously. Hence, future studies are required to investigate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms and to verify whether the positive findings can be confirmed and transferred to other needy cohorts, such as older adults with dementia, sarcopenia and/or dynapenia.

European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 Background Aging, the brain, and cognition Throughout the lifespan, the human organism under- goes considerable changes. As a consequence of aging, the structure and function of organic systems i.e., brain can be negatively affected, which in turn can converge in a decline of individual capabilities e.g., cognition. In this regard, in recent years, evidence has shown that the hippocampus 1–4 and the grey matter in the frontal lobe 1–3, 5–12 are affected by age-related shrinking. In contrast, the grey matter volume of other brain struc- tures such as the parietal and occipital cortices have been reported to change slightly with increasing age 1, 5, 8, whereas a severe decline in white matter volume of the prefrontal cortex PFC is most pronounced in the very oldest 1, 8, 9, 13, 14. These age-related changes in brain structure 15, 16 are assumed to play major roles in the worsening of cognition functions, such as process- ing speed and memory 17–20. In fact, in older adults, it was observed that a decrease in hippocampal volume is associated with worsening of memory performance 21–23. Conversely, an increase in hippocampal volume after a yearlong aerobic training intervention was associ- ated with memory improvements . These findings suggest that the preservation of brain structures e.g., hippocampus is important to ensure the proper func- tioning of cognitive processes e.g., memory. Similar to the relationship of brain structure and cognition, it is assumed that changes in brain function e.g., brain acti- vation during a cognitive task contribute to changes in cognition 16, 25–27. Such an intertwined relationship between brain activation and cognition is underpinned by the findings linking activation of the PFC to behav- ioral performance in executive function tasks 28–31, in visuomotor tasks , or in working memory tasks 33– 35. Currently, several hypotheses exist that aim to explain age-related alterations in brain activation and cognition 16, 25–27. For instance, the HAROLD model predicts that there is hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults in the PFC during the execution of memory tasks 27, 36. In the compensation-related utilization of the neural circuits hypothesis CRUNCH, it is postulated that adults will recruit more brain regions mainly the PFC as the task load increases and that older adults need to re- cruit these brain regions at lower levels of cognitive load than younger adults e.g., during working memory tasks 26, 37–39. In the Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cog- nition STAC, it is postulated that increased brain activity with age, especially in the PFC, is a compensatory mech- anism caused by reorganization of the brain in response to the age-related decline in neural structures and neural functioning 16, 39, 40. To date, none of these hypotheses satisfactorily explain the observed age-related changes in brain function , but all of these hypotheses emphasize the important role of the PFC in age-related functional brain changes. It is well recognized in the literature that physical exercises 28–30, 42, 43 and physical training 44–47 lead to positive changes in cognitive performance e.g., executive functions and brain activation patterns. Furthermore, the changes in brain activation patterns i.e., shown by higher levels of oxygenated hemoglobin in brain associated with cognitive performance regions improvements 28–30, 47, which illustrate the important role of physical interventions in preserving cognition and brain health. are In summary, distinct cognitive functions e.g., mem- ory are negatively affected, and substantial changes in brain structure e.g., shrinkage of hippocampus and brain function e.g., compensatory brain activation; i.e., of PFC occur as consequences of “normal” aging. Not- ably, regular engagement in physical exercise is a valu- able strategy to counteract age-related decline in brain and cognition 48–52. Aging, muscular system, and cognition There is solid evidence in the literature that muscle mass sarcopenia 53–57 and muscular strength dynapenia 53, 57–59, which constitute the ability to produce mus- cular force and power , decline gradually as a function of age. Notably, the age-related decrease in muscular strength was noticed to be more pronounced than the de- crease in muscle mass 61–63. Moreover, the decline in maximum muscular strength is more serious in the lower limbs than in upper limbs 62, 64–67. In general, it was observed that the age-related loss in, for instance, max- imum isokinetic hip/leg extensor strength is rather min- life but accelerates imal until considerably thereafter 58, 68–70. Potential reasons for the pronounced decline in muscular strength are the re- duction in cross-sectional area of the muscle fibers 64, 71 as well as the loss of muscle fibers and motor units 55, 56, 58, 61, 72, 73. However, appropriate levels of muscular strength are needed for independent and healthy living. For instance, an appropriate level of muscular strength in the muscles of the lower limbs e.g., hip and leg extensors is required to ensure proper function for engaging in activ- ities of daily living e.g., balance and gait 74, 75. Hence, it is not surprising that a decline in isokinetic muscular strength in leg extensors is associated with reduced mobil- ity 76–78 and increased risk of mortality 77, 79, 80. the fifth decade of However, there is growing evidence that an appropri- ate level of muscular strength is also linked to brain health and functioning e.g., cognitive functions. In this regard, it has been reported in the literature that higher levels of isokinetic strength of the M. quadriceps femoris are linked to better performance in general cognitive abilities operationalized by Mini-Mental State Examin- and to better performance in ation MMSE Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 executive functions 82, 83. This link is further rein- forced by the findings that higher leg power and higher whole-body muscle strength are associated with higher scores in standardized cognitive test batter- ies. Furthermore, higher handgrip strength is linked to higher scores in general cognitive abilities e.g., opera- tionalized by MMSE 86, 87 and to higher scores in standardized cognitive test batteries 88–90. Moreover, it was observed that gains in dynamic muscular strength assessed by one repetition maximum in different resist- ance exercises after 6 months of progressive resistance training mediate improvements in global cognitive per- formance according to the Alzheimer’s Disease Assess- ment Scale–cognitive subscale to the previously mentioned finding, reported that changes in isokinetic knee extension and knee flexion torques after 3 months of progressive resistance training mediate improvements in executive functions . Not- ably, a meta-analysis did not observe a correlation be- tween muscle size and cognition but reported that both muscle function e.g., muscular strength and muscle structure e.g., muscle size were linked to brain structure . . Similar it was Taken together, during aging processes, a substantial de- cline in muscular strength, especially in lower limb mus- cles, occurs, and accumulating evidence suggests that lower muscular strengths are linked to poorer cognitive performance. Hence, resistance strength exercises a sin- gle bout of resistance exercise, also referred to as acute ex- ercise and resistance strength training more than one resistance exercise session, also referred to as chronic exercise; see also section ‘Data extraction’ seem to be promising activities to ensure the preservation of physical functioning and cognitive functions with aging. Resistance exercises, resistance training, brain, and cognition One physical intervention strategy that is frequently recom- mended to counteract the age-related deterioration of both physical functioning and cognition is the continuous and regular execution of resistance exercises and/or resistance training 94–106. There is solid evidence in the form of sys- tematic reviews and meta-analyses indicating that resistance exercises and resistance training for distinction, see section ‘Data extraction’ have substantial benefits for specific do- mains of cognitive functions e.g., executive functions 105, 107–111, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of resistance exercise-induced improvements in cognitive functions are not yet fully understood 107, 110. As shown in Fig. 1, cognitive improvements in response to resistance exercises and/or resistance training are based on changes on multiple levels of analysis 112, 113. At the first level, molecular and cellular changes occur, which are summarized in the “neurotrophic hypothesis” 114–117. The “neurotrophic hypothesis” claims that in response to physical exercises e.g., resistance exercises, a pronounced release of distinct neurochemicals occurs e.g., brain- 114–117. The derived neurotrophic factor pronounced release of specific neurochemicals triggers complex neurobiological processes evoking functional and/or structural brain changes that facilitate, at best, im- provements in cognitive functions 24, 50, 114, 118–120. With regard to the molecular and cellular levels, a system- atic review summarized the evidence of resistance exercise and resistance training-induced changes in the release of several myokines e.g., BDNF and highlighted their posi- tive effects on cognitive functions . However, with re- to functional and structural brain changes and spect socioemotional changes see Level 2 and Level 3 in Fig. 1, BDNF Fig. 1 Schematic illustration of the objective of the present systematic review and the levels of analysis. ‘a’ indicates that the brain could be regarded as an outcome, a mediator or a predictor . ‘b’ indicates several possibilities for how structural and functional brain changes, socioemotional changes, and cognitive changes are intertwined .

European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 knowledge about resistance exercise and/or resistance training-induced changes is still relatively scarce, and the available literature has not yet been systematically pooled. In particular, the pooling of available evidence regarding functional and structural brain changes is needed because the brain may act as a mediator for the effect of resistance exercises and/or resistance training on cognition 112, 122. Such a systematic pooling of available evidence is needed to provide evidence-based recommendations for individualized exercise prescriptions 123–125. Because resistance exercises and/or resistance training is a promis- ing strategy that could “hit many birds with one stone” i.e., simultaneously counteracting different types of phys- ical and brain-related health problems, the objective of this systematic review is to provide an overview of resist- ance exercise and/or resistance training-induced functional and/or structural brain changes that are related to changes in cognitive functions. Methods Search strategy and process In accordance with the guidelines for systematic reviews , two independent researchers conducted a system- atic literature search on the 25th of April 2019 across the following six electronic databases applied specifica- tions: PubMed all fields, Scopus title, abstract, key- words, Web of Science title, PsycInfo all text, SportDiscus abstract, and the Cochrane Library title, abstract, keywords; trials. The following terms were used as search strings: cid:1 “strength exercise” OR “strength training” OR “resistance exercise” OR “resistance training” OR “weight exercise” OR “weight training” OR “weight lifting” OR “weight bearing” OR “elastic band” OR toning OR calisthenics OR “functional training” AND cid:1 mental OR neuropsychological OR brain OR cogniti OR neurocogni OR executive OR attention OR memory OR “response time” OR “reaction time” OR accuracy OR error OR inhibition OR visual OR spatial OR visuospatial OR processing OR recall OR learning OR language OR oddball OR “task switching” OR “problem solving” OR Flanker OR Stroop OR Sternberg OR “Trail Making” OR “Tower of London” OR “Tower of Hanoi” OR “Wisconsin Card Sorting” OR “Simon task” AND cid:1 cortex OR hemodynamic OR oxygenation OR “grey matter” OR “gray matter” OR “white matter” OR “brain volume” OR plasticity OR neuroelectric OR electrophysiological OR “P 300” OR “P 3” OR “event- related potentials” OR ERP OR Alpha OR Beta OR Gamma OR Theta OR NIR OR fNIRS OR “functional near-infrared spectroscopy” OR “near-infrared spectroscopy” OR “functional near-infrared spectroscopic” OR “optical imaging system” OR “optical topography” OR fMRI OR MRI OR “MR imaging” OR “magnetic resonance imaging” OR EEG OR electroencephalography OR electrocorticography OR MEG OR magnetoencephalography OR PET OR “positron emission tomography” Afterwards, the results of the systematic search were loaded into a citation manager Citavi 6.3, which was used for further analyses and for removing duplicates see Fig. 2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Screening for relevant studies was conducted using the established PICOS-principle 126, 127. The acronym “PICOS” stands for participants P, intervention I, com- parisons C, outcomes O, and study design S 126, 127. The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were used: P we applied no restrictions and included all age groups regardless of pathologies; I only studies involving resistance exercises and/or resistance training were in- cluded; C in this systematic literature search, no specific restrictions were used; O studies considered relevant assessed functional brain changes and/or structural brain changes related to cognitive changes; S interventional or cross-sectional studies. As shown in Fig. 3, 46 studies were excluded after full text screening because they did not meet our inclusion criteria. Eight studies were excluded because they only assessed functional or structural brain changes but did not measure cognitive performance 128–135. Vice versa, 38 studies were excluded because they solely measured changes in cognitive performance without quantifying functional or structural brain changes 81, 91, 136–171. Data extraction We extracted information about the first author, year of publication, population characteristics including age, gender, cognitive status, exercise characteristics e.g., muscle action, loading and volume, rest period between sets/between exercises, repetition velocity, frequency, re- sistance exercise selection, cognitive testing e.g., tested cognitive domain, administration after exercise cessa- tion, and functional and structural brain data. The extraction of information followed the recommendations of Hecksteden et al. . Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 Fig. 2 Flow chart with information about the search, screening, and selection processes that led to the identification of relevant articles included in this systematic review Prior to presentation of the findings, it is necessary to clarify the different terms used in the field of exercise cog- nition. ‘Physical activity’ is defined as any muscle-induced bodily movements that increase energy expenditure from wide range of acute and chronic physical activities e.g., from housework to resistance exercises/resistance training. Specific forms of structured, planned, and regularly chron- ically conducted physical activities aiming to increase indi- vidual capabilities in a certain fitness domain are referred to as ‘training’ or ‘chronic repetitive exercises’ 174, 176– 178. Single sessions of physical activities exercises are re- ferred to as ‘an acute single bout of physical activities’ or ‘physical exercises’ 174, 179, 180. In this article, we use the term ‘resistance training’ when more than two exercise sessions were conducted. Consequently, a single session of resistance exercises is referred to as ‘a single acute bout of resistance exercises’ and/or ‘resistance exercises’. Further- more, we use ‘exercise prescription’ as an umbrella term to denote exercise e.g., load for an exercise and training vari- ables e.g., frequency. Risk of bias assessment Two evaluators independently performed the risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias tool . The Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias tool evaluates the methodological quality of a study by rating the risk of bias in distinct criteria see Figure 3 as being ‘low’, ‘high’, or ‘unclear’ . Any discrepan- cies in the ratings of the risk of bias were resolved by a discussion among the two evaluators or/and the consult- ation of the third author of the review. The risk of bias assessment is summarized in Fig. 3. Results Risk of bias As shown in Fig. 3, the results regarding the judgment of risk of bias are heterogeneous. In the domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment, the majority of studies were rated as low risk of bias or unclear risk of bias. The reviewed studies were judged as having an unclear risk of bias in those domains because procedures Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 Participants’ characteristics and study design In the reviewed studies, the effect of resistance exercises and/or resistance training on cognition and the brain was investigated in different cohorts, including healthy young adults 43, 182, 183, healthy older adults 44, 45, 184–188, older adults with mild cognitive impairment 188–191, older adults in an early stage of dementia , and individuals with multiple sclerosis . De- tailed information about participant characteristics e.g., age, height, body mass is provided in Table 1. Regarding the study design, almost all studies could be classified as interventional and as randomized controlled trials 43–45, 183–186, 188–190, 195, 197. Additionally, three resistance exercise studies 43, 182, 183, 195 accounted for circadian variability as a possible moderating factor. Resistance exercise characteristics In four studies investigating the acute effects of single resistance exercise sessions on cognitive performance and on functional neuroelectric or hemodynamic brain processes, the exercise sessions lasted approximately 30 min or 40 min 43, 182, 195. Studies on the effects of resistance training on cognition and functional and/or structural brain changes involved groups who trained 1 day 45, 184–186, 2 days 45, 184– 186, 188–190, 193, 197, or 3 days per week 44, 187, 191. Exercise sessions in the resistance training studies lasted , 10 weeks , 12 weeks , 16 weeks 44, 191, weeks 45, 184–186, 189. In most of the resistance train- ing studies reviewed, the exercise sessions were conducted in supervised classes 44, 45, 184–187, 189–191, 193, 197. Furthermore, in most of the reviewed studies, partic- ipants were asked to perform two or three sets during the exercise sessions with a minimum of six and a maximum of ten repetitions of upper and lower body exercises at a load ranging from 50 to 92% of 1RM one repetition max- imum using free weights and/or machines for a detailed overview, see Table 1. Main findings Functional brain changes and cognition Hemodynamic functional brain changes and cognition With regard to an acute bout of resistance exercises, in healthy young adults, a decrease in tissue oxygenation index in the left prefrontal cortex during the Stoop test and improved behavioral performance i.e., faster reac- tion time and higher number of solved items in neutral condition was observed after a single bout of high- intensity resistance exercise . Fig. 3 Analysis of the risk of bias in the included studies in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. This figure was created using Review Manager . A “green plus” indicates a low risk of bias, a “yellow question mark” indicates an unclear risk of bias, and a “red minus” denotes a high risk of bias were not described in sufficient detail e.g., method of ran- dom sequence generation. In the domains of incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias, most studies were judged as having a low risk of bias. Herold et al.

Not applicable, RCT Randomized controlled trials, RM Repetition maximum, RE Resistance exercises, RT Resistance training, SD Standard deviation, WL Wait list With regard to resistance training, after a 16-week intervention with healthy older adults, oxygenated hemoglobin and total hemoglobin were lowered in the left prefrontal cortex during the Stroop task Stroop interference effect, posttest compared with pretest, while cognitive task performance i.e., reaction time was improved . At the end of 52 weeks of resistance training, older adults who had conducted resistance ex- ercises twice a week exhibited better performance in tasks of executive functions i.e., Stroop test than those who had performed balance and toning exercises . Furthermore, in the same study, the hemodynamic re- sponse during the incongruent flanker condition was in- creased in the left anterior insula and the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, whereas the hemodynamic response during the congruent flanker condition decreased in the same areas . In older individuals with mild cognitive impairment MCI, the right lingual and occipital-fusiform gyri and the right frontal pole exhibited increased activation during the associative memory test after a twice-weekly performed re- sistance training lasting for 52 weeks when compared with older individuals conducting balance and toning exercises in this time period . Furthermore, in this study, a posi- tive correlation between increased hemodynamic activity in the right lingual gyrus and improved associative memory performance was observed . After 26 weeks of resist- ance training, decreased resting-state functional connectiv- ity of the PCFC with the left inferior temporal lobe and the anterior cingulate cortex and between the HIPFC and the right inferior temporal lobe was observed in older adults with MCI . In the same study, an increase in resting- state functional connectivity between the HIPFC and the right middle frontal lobe was evident in older adults with MCI in the resistance training group . Neuroelectric functional brain changes and cognition With regard to an acute bout of resistance exercises, cognitive performance was improved in younger adults 182, 183 and older adults with MCI . After exer- cising in younger adults, an increase in the P3 amplitude during a Go/No-Go task combined with the Eriksen Flanker paradigm was observed , and in older adults with MCI, the P3 amplitude across all electrode positions except Pz during the Eriksen Flanker task was larger posttest compared with pretest . Further- more, and condition-dependent increase in P3 amplitude obtained during the Stroop task was observed . In incongru- ent trials, larger P3 amplitudes were observed 30 min and 40 min after exercise cessation, whereas in congru- larger P3 amplitudes were observed 10 min ent trials, time-dependent in younger adults, a Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 and 40 min after exercise cessation . However, in the same study, no statistically significant differences be- tween the resistance exercise group and the loadless movement group were observed . Additionally, lar- ger P3 amplitudes were associated with lower serum cortisol levels after an acute bout of resistance exercise in younger adults . With regard to resistance training, after 9 weeks of training three times per week, the elderly participants showed a significant decrease in N1 latencies at the Fz and Cz positions during an auditory task, whereas the N1-P2, P2-N2 and N2-P3 amplitudes at Fz and the N1-P2 amplitude at Cz increased . In comparison to both an aerobic training group and an inactive control group, the resistance training group showed a greater absolute reduction in P2 and N2 latencies and larger ab- solute increase in N1-P2, P2-N2, and N2-P3 amplitudes . Furthermore, after 10 weeks of resistance training in healthy older adults and in older adults at an early stage of dementia, a decrease in beta asymmetry, a de- crease in N200 A asymmetry, and an increase in theta asymmetry was observed . The decrease in N200 A asymmetry was significantly negatively correlated with improvements in the Fuld immediate recall score and the Fuld delayed recall score, while the increase in delta asymmetry was significantly positively correlated with a better Fuld delayed recall score . After resistance training with elastic bands for 12 weeks, healthy older adults showed a decrease in relative theta power at P3 and P4, but their cognitive measures remained un- changed . However, in the same study, exercising older adults with MCI exhibited significantly higher scores in the digit span backward test than their non- exercising counterparts . Furthermore, from pre- to posttest, theta power at F3 increased and alpha power at T3 decreased in exercising older adults with MCI . After 16 weeks of resistance training in older adults with amnestic MCI, larger P3 amplitudes during a task- switching paradigm were observed . Furthermore, in the same study, decreased reaction times i.e., in the non- switching condition and in the switching condition and higher accuracy rates i.e., in the pure condition, in the non-switching condition, and in the switching condition were noticed in the resistance training group and the aer- obic training group when the posttest was compared with the pretest . Additionally, in the resistance training group, a positive correlation between changes in serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 IGF-1 and P3 am- plitudes measured during switching condition and a negative correlation between serum levels of tumor necro- sis factor-alpha and accuracy rates in the switching condi- tion were observed, which both barely failed to attain statistical significance . In another study, 48 weeks of resistance training led to superior cognitive performance i.e., reaction time as well as to larger P3a and P3b ampli- tudes in an oddball task . Moreover, serum IGF-1 concentrations increased and were correlated with faster reaction times and larger P3b amplitudes only in the re- sistance group . Structural brain changes and cognition After resistance training performed once or twice weekly for 52 weeks, compared with older adults conducting balance and toning exercises, older adults in the resist- ance training groups exhibited i an increased perform- ance in Stroop test , ii a reduction in whole brain volume , iii a lower volume of cortical white mat- ter atrophy , and iv a lower degree of cortical white matter lesions . In older female adults with probable MCI, resistance training over 26 weeks did not led to significant changes in hippocampal volume . In another study, older adults with MCI resistance training performed twice a week for 26 weeks exhibited improved ADAS-Cog scores global cognition assessed with Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale and in- creased the cortical thickness of grey matter in the pos- terior cingulate gyrus . Moreover, the increase in grey matter thickness was negatively correlated with ADAS-Cog scores, indicating better cognitive perform- ance . In individuals with multiple sclerosis MS, resistance training lasting 24 weeks led to an increase in cortical thickness in the anterior cingulate sulcus and gyrus, the temporal pole, the inferior temporal sulcus, and the orbital H-shaped sulcus . The increased thickness in the temporal pole was significantly nega- tively correlated with lower scores on the Expanded Dis- lower disability .

Discussion Risk of bias In general, our results regarding the source of the risk of bias are somewhat heterogeneous see Fig. 3; neverthe- less, the overall quality of the majority of the reviewed studies can be regarded as sufficiently high. However, the risk of bias could be further minimized by proper planning of the study, which would strengthen the plausibility of observed effects. To ensure and enhance the study quality, it appears imperative that future stud- ies report their procedures in sufficient detail e.g., exer- cise and training variables and pay attention to established guidelines such as the CONSORT statement or the STROBE statement .

Therefore, our knowledge about the effect of resistance exercises and/or resistance training on cognitive functions is limited to these co- horts, and further investigations with other cohorts are required. In particular, older adults with sarcopenia are a key group because there is a high prevalence ranging from 1 to 33% of this condition in various older popula- tions , which poses major economic costs to the Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 welfare system . Sarcopenia comprises the age- related loss of muscle mass 206–210 but in the litera- ture the term has often been incorrectly extended to the age-related loss of muscle function e.g., muscle strength 210–219. The latter one should be referred to as dynapenia which encompasses the age-related loss of muscle function e.g., loss of muscular strength and power 209–211, 220. However, age-related muscular changes e.g., sarcopenia could also lead to a decline in cognitive performance 221, 222. Hence, older adults with sarcopenia and/or dynapenia may profit in two ways physically and cognitively from resistance exer- cises/resistance training. In the terms of study design, in future resistance exer- cise and/or resistance training studies, moderator vari- ables such as gender 223–226 or genotype 227, 228, which may influence the effectiveness of the resistance exercise and/or resistance training, should be considered and analyzed. The assessment and analysis of moderators may help provide a better understanding of the observed inter-individual variability regarding the effect of physical exercise e.g., resistance training on the brain and on cog- nitive functions and help to foster the optimization of physical exercise interventions . Furthermore, chro- nobiological factors such as circadian variability should be considered since they affect muscular adaptions in re- sponse to resistance exercises 229–232 and affect cogni- tive performance 233–235. However, hemodynamic responses are reported to be relatively unaffected by, for instance, circadian variability . Moreover, larger cohorts and longer intervention intervals could be beneficial especially in f MRI studies for increasing the external validity and for adaptation processes to manifest . In addition, concerning cognitive testing, it seems advisable to use standardized sets of cognitive tests or to employ the latent variable approach create an unobserved latent variable for a distinct set of cognitive tests . In this context, the ‘human baseline hypothesis’ should be considered, which claims that the baseline values of strength e.g., grip strength, knee extensor strength assessed prior to resistance training and/or after a detraining period are a more appropriate indicator of health outcomes than the training-related increase in strength values . With regard to upcoming cross-sectional studies, neu- roimaging methods e.g., fNIRS, see should be employed as they help to better understand the associ- ation between superior cognitive performance e.g., in global cognitive abilities and superior muscular per- formance previously operationalized by i hand grip strength 86, 88, 89, ii isokinetic quadriceps strength 82, 83, iii leg power , or iv whole-body muscular strength . Functional brain changes and cognition in response to resistance exercises or resistance training Hemodynamic functional brain changes and cognition Currently, only a few studies have investigated the in- fluence of resistance exercises and/or resistance train- ing on functional brain parameters in healthy adults during standardized cognitive tasks. However, regard- less of whether resistance exercises were conducted as an acute bout or over a period of 16 weeks , proxies of cortical activation in the prefrontal cortex during the Stroop test were found to be decreased. In another resistance training study 52 weeks, a decrease in brain activation was observed exclusively during the relatively easy task condition, whereas increased activa- tion was found in the more difficult task condition . These observations stand in contrast to the findings of acute aerobic exercise studies 28, 29, 43 and aerobic training studies , in which, in general, increased ac- tivation of prefrontal areas during cognitive testing was observed after exercising . Notably, similar to the findings of most aerobic exercise or aerobic training studies, the reviewed resistance exercise and/or resist- ance training studies also reported improved cognitive functions 43–45. Hence, decreases in the applied proxies of neuronal activity might indicate more effi- cient processing or automatization of cognitive pro- cesses. Moreover, it is likely that the decrease in brain activation in response to resistance exercises and/or re- sistance training is related to neurobiological mecha- nisms different from those induced by aerobic exercises or aerobic training 107, 223, 240. Future studies are urgently needed to investigate the underlying neurobio- logical mechanisms of different types of acute physical exercises e.g., resistance exercises vs. aerobic exercises and chronic physical training e.g., resistance training vs. aerobic training. Analysis of the neurobiological changes in response to different physical exercise/train- ing interventions will also contribute to a better under- standing of the functional changes in the brain. In this regard, Liu-Ambrose et al. noticed that after the completion of a 52-week long resistance training pro- gram, functional brain activations in the left anterior insula extending from the lateral orbital frontal cortex and in the anterior portion of the left middle temporal gyrus during execution of a cognitive task were altered . The left anterior insula, for instance, plays an im- portant role in successful performance in response in- hibition tasks , which may be based on their involvement in i the stopping ability , ii the as- surance of general task accuracy , and iii main- taining a stable task set control 243, 244. The left middle temporal gyrus is especially activated in com- plex Go−/No-Go situations . However, in contrast, task-related in comparable aerobic training, higher Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 activation in prefrontal areas and parietal cortices and decreased activation of the anterior cingulate cortex was observed . Parietal areas and prefrontal areas 248, 249 are involved in a variety of cognitive processes, among them attention 250, 251. In particu- lar, the parietal areas 252, 253 and the prefrontal areas 254, 255 are strongly involved in selective attention and the frontoparietal network in maintaining and ma- nipulating task-relevant information in working mem- ory . In the context of attentional processes, the anterior cingulate cortex is also an important structure because it allocates attentional resources based on the recruitment of task-appropriate processing centers . Moreover, the anterior cingulate cortex is acti- vated in conflict processing where erroneous responses are highly probable 257–260. Taken together, resistance training might be beneficial for cognitive processes that aim to avoid unwanted responses e.g., maintaining stable task set control and increased stop efficacy, whereas aer- obic exercises may enhance cognitive processes such as selective attention e.g., maintaining task-relevant infor- mation . Further research is needed to verify this assumption. i The positive effect of resistance training on brain health is also underpinned by findings of Nagamatsu et al. , who observed higher cortical activation during an associative memory task in older individuals with MCI after they had undergone long-term resistance training 52 weeks. Moreover, this higher cortical activ- ity was positively correlated with improvements in cog- nitive performance . Another mechanism through which resistance training may ensure or/and improve brain health in MCI may be related to the modulation of functional connectivity. It was observed that the resting-state functional connectivity between posterior cingulate cortex and other brain regions is generally de- creased in individuals with MCI 261–264, ii func- tional connectivity between the posterior parietal cortex and the temporal cortex is associated with performance on neuropsychological tests , and iii the resting- state functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions is disturbed in individuals with MCI or Alzheimer’s disease 266, 267. Notably, resistance training lasting 26 weeks increases the func- tional connectivity among the posterior cingulate cortex, the left inferior temporal lobe, and the anterior cingulate cortex and between the hippocampus and the right mid- dle frontal lobe . Based on the mentioned changes in resting-state functional connectivity in neurological diseases e.g., MCI and the positive influence of resist- ance training on resting-state functional connectivity, it can be speculated that resistance training may be a beneficial intervention strategy for ensuring or/and im- proving brain health and cognition in those cohorts. 270, 271 Neuroelectric functional brain changes and cognition A higher P3 amplitude also known as P 300 was ob- served in younger adults after an acute bout of resist- ance exercises 182, 183 and in healthy older adults after 48 weeks of resistance training . Furthermore, a higher P3 amplitude was observed in individuals with MCI after an acute bout of resistance exercises or after 16 weeks of resistance training . Elevated P3 amplitudes are generally associated with neural activity and cognitive processes 268, 269. Upregulation of the P3 amplitude after resistance exercises and/or resistance training may be beneficial for brain health because di- minished P3 amplitudes were observed in older individ- uals and individuals with neurological diseases e.g., Alzheimer’s disease . The associa- tions between event-related potentials e.g., P3 ampli- tude and neurotrophic factors obtained after acute resistance exercises 182, 195 and/or resistance training support the “neurotropic hypotheses” 114–117. Profound changes in neuroelectric outcomes were also observed after 12 weeks of resistance training with de- creased resting-state theta power in older adults with and without MCI and increased resting-state alpha power in older adults with MCI . The relevance of these findings is currently unclear because contradictory observations regarding meaningful changes in alpha and theta power are found in the literature. For instance, on the one hand, more resting-state alpha power and less resting-state theta power were associated with better cognitive performance 273, 274, whereas, on the other hand, it has also been reported that higher resting-state theta power is linked to superior cognitive performance e.g., in category fluency task 275, 276. Nevertheless, the notion that resistance training positively affects brain health was clearly confirmed by the observation of statis- tically significant correlations between neuroelectric changes e.g., in asymmetry index and changes in mem- ory performance in older adults in response to a resist- ance intervention lasting 10 weeks . In addition, Özkaya et al. observed differences in neuroelectric parameters as a function of the type of physical training. This observation supports the idea that resistance and aerobic training have different impacts on the underlying neurobiological processes 223, 225, 240. In sum, based on the small number of studies, it is too early to draw generalizable conclusions with respect to functional brain changes, but the available results suggest that resistance exercises and/or resistance training can be a promising strategy to ensure brain health. However, further studies are urgently needed to investigate the effect of an acute bout of resistance exercises and/or resistance training on functional brain changes. Here, upcoming studies should also pay attention to the investigation of neurobio- logical processes that may cause functional brain changes. Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 Structural brain changes and cognition in response to resistance training In response to resistance training over an intervention period of 52 weeks performed two times per week, i a reduction in whole brain volume , ii a reduction in cortical white matter atrophy , and iii a reduc- tion in white matter lesions were observed in com- parison to training with balance or toning exercises. The reduction in whole brain volume is surprising because, in general, ‘more’ is often associated with ‘better’. How- ever, it is assumed that the reduction in whole brain vol- ume is perhaps caused by the improvement of certain brain pathologies, in particular the removal of amyloid plaques and shifts in cerebral fluids 186, 277, 278, which, in turn, might positively influence brain health. This view is supported by the recent findings of Yoon et al. , who observed a relationship between brain amyloid-β levels and hand grip strength e.g., high levels of brain amyloid-β and low grip strength. The removal of amyloid plaques could be one possible neurobiological mechanism explaining the observed improvements in executive functions because accumulation of amyloid-β plaque is commonly linked to worsened domain-specific cognitive functions e.g., executive func- tions and memory 280–282, and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease 283–286. Furthermore, given that white matter abnormalities e.g., high load of white matter lesions are linked to a decline in cognitive functions i.e., global cognition and processing speed 13, 287–290 and are associated with neurological diseases such as dementia 291, 292, the resistance training-induced changes in white matter e.g., reduced volume of lesions and reduced atrophy are likely to be beneficial for brain health. Notably, the reduced volumes of white matter lesions after 52 weeks of resistance training are linked to increased gait speed . Based on the findings that both slower gait speed and white matter lesion load are linked to an increased fall risk, the positive changes within the white matter in response to resistance training suggest that en- gaging in resistance training could play a substantial role in preservation of the neural correlates of all-day tasks e.g., safe walking. In response to resistance training, which was per- formed twice a week for 26 weeks, grey matter thick- ness in the posterior cingulate cortex was found to increase significantly . This increase in cortical thickness of the posterior cingulate cortex was linked to improved global cognitive performance . This as- neurobiobehavioral sumption that the posterior cingulate cortex is im- portant still no for cognition, although there is agreement about its exact role . However, reduc- tions in metabolism and volume were relationship underpins the In the observed in the posterior cingulate cortex in Alzhei- mer’s disease. Hence, the possible ability to shape this cortical structure by engaging in resistance training is a promising approach to ensure brain health and to prevent neurological diseases. context of neurological diseases, it was also observed that resist- ance training for 24 weeks increased the cortical thickness in distinct areas, such as the temporal pole, in individuals with MS. The increased cortical thick- ness in the temporal pole was associated with better scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale EDSS, suggesting that resistance training has a posi- tive impact on brain health and functional abilities in this cohort. There are even reports in the literature that a single resistance exercise leg press has pro- found effects on brain volumes but without a rela- tion to cognitive functions in healthy older adults. Here, statistically significant increases in grey matter density in the posterior and anterior lobe of the cere- bellum, the superior frontal gyrus in the frontal lobe, and the anterior cingulate cortex in the limbic lobe were observed . In summary, these results sup- port the view that robust neuroplastic changes can be evoked through resistance training, which contribute to the maintenance of brain health. Interestingly, one of the reviewed studies directly com- pared resistance and aerobic trainings and found no sta- tistically significant difference in hippocampal volume changes between trainings . Although an increase in hippocampal volume was reported after both aerobic and resistance training in older adults , few brain imaging studies are currently available that directly compare different types of physical training. For in- stance, it was observed that dancing conducted for sev- eral months led to a greater increase in cortical grey matter in frontal and temporal regions 298–300 and in hippocampal volumes than a combination of re- sistance, endurance, and flexibility training. Hence, com- paring different interventions e.g., resistance training vs. aerobic training vs. dancing with regard to their effectiveness in evoking structural and functional brain changes is an interesting topic for fur- ther studies. Such knowledge is necessary to foster the development of interventions, individualized physical which are deemed to be more effective than the ‘one- size-fits-all approach’ 125, 223, 302. types of physical Taken together, resistance training reduces white mat- ter atrophy and increases grey matter volumes in distinct brain areas. Based on the observed relationship between structural changes and behavior 185, 190, the positive role of resistance training in ensuring and improving brain health is reinforced. Further studies comparing dif- ferent types of physical interventions with respect to structural brain changes are required. Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 Neurophysiological adaptation processes in connection with resistance exercises and resistance training Structural brain changes in response to resistance train- ing rely at least partly on the modulation of specific mo- lecular and cellular pathways that are involved in neuroplasticity and – consequently – in positive effects of cognitive performance 112, 240. In this context, the modulating role of resistance exercises and/or resistance training on the release of neurochemicals such as BDNF, IGF-1, and homocysteine is discussed in the literature 121, 223, 303, 304. In the following, we briefly outline how these neurochemicals may contribute to the ob- served functional and structural brain changes. In particular, structural brain changes after physical in- terventions are assumed to be mediated by BDNF 114, 118, 119, 223, 240. In addition, serum BDNF concentra- tions have been linked to spatial memory performance and higher serum BDNF concentrations in response to acute physical exercises or physical training have been associated with improvements in execu- tive functions. Furthermore, BDNF is involved in many long- neuroplastic processes, such as synaptogenesis, term potentiation of synaptic transmission, regulation of the differentiation of neuronal precursor cells, and neur- onal survival . The important role of BDNF in neu- roplasticity is underpinned by the findings that reduced serum BDNF concentrations were linked to a decline in hippocampal volume and that changes in serum BDNF concentrations after aerobic training were associated with hippocampal volume changes . Although hippo- campal changes could not be observed in one of the reviewed studies after 26 weeks of resistance training , there is solid evidence that resistance exercises especially at high-load conditions 307–311 and resist- ance training especially in males 308, 312 upregulate serum BDNF concentrations. Such an increase in re- sponse to resistance exercise and resistance training was also reported for plasma BDNF . Notably, it is as- sumed that concentrations of BDNF stored in immune cells and/or platelets are mirrored in the level of serum BNDF, while plasma BDNF is a marker of the concentra- tion of freely circulating BDNF 314, 315. Based on the previously mentioned connections between serum BDNF, brain physiology, and cognition i.e., executive functions, it can be speculated that BDNF-driven mech- anisms might contribute to neurocognitive changes after resistance exercises and/or resistance training. However, further studies are urgently needed to deepen our know- ledge regarding the interrelationship between resistance exercises and/or resistance training-induced expression relation to of serum BDNF in humans and its functional and structural brain changes as well as to cognitive performance as a function of age. IGF-1 Engaging in resistance exercises and resistance train- ing 187, 317 fosters the expression of IGF-1, which is predominantly released by the liver global output, 70% of total circulating IGF-1, the musculature local output, and the brain local output itself 318, 319. Because cir- culating IGF-1 can cross the blood-brain barrier BBB, lo- cally expressed IGF-1 e.g., from musculature is likely to be available in the brain 318, 319. IGF-1 triggers various mechanisms that contribute to neuroplasticity in the hu- man brain, such as synaptic processes e.g., long-term po- tentiation 320, 321, angiogenesis in the brain, axon outgrowth, dendritic maturation, and synaptogenesis 319, 322. Moreover, IGF-1 likely plays an important role in structural grey matter changes because it is involved in neuroplastic mechanisms that foster neuronal survival such as i proliferation of neural cells 324, 325, ii inhibition of apoptosis of neural cells 324, 325, and iii protection of neurons against toxicity by, for instance, amyloid peptides . While there is some evidence that higher serum IGF-1 levels are linked to greater total brain volumes or hippocampal volume , the exact roles of IGF-1 in the central nervous system remain elu- sive . However, the assumption that IGF-1-activated pathways play an important role in changing brain func- tion is underpinned by the findings of a reviewed study that reported higher peripheral serum IGF-1 concentra- tions after 52 weeks of resistance training in healthy older individuals alongside behavioral e.g., improved accuracy and reaction times in executive function tests and func- tional improvements e.g., P3 amplitude 187, 191. Such a relationship between cognitive performance and periph- eral serum IGF-1 concentrations would be in accordance with previous findings linking peripheral serum IGF-1 levels to cognitive performance e.g., global cognition assessed by MMSE in older individuals and individ- uals with MCI . Notably, it has also been reported that solely an optimal concentration of peripheral serum IGF-1 is associated with superior global cognition assessed by MMSE and processing capacity , which could be related to the multiple and divergent roles that IGF-1 plays in the human brain 319, 332. On the one hand, IGF-1 is linked to beneficial processes e.g., stimu- lating synaptogenesis and contributing to neuronal cell survival, but on the other hand, IGF-1 is also associated with detrimental processes e.g., generation of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of autophagy . There is currently insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding the relationship between physical exercise, modulation of IGF-1, structural and functional brain changes, and cognitive functions . Hence, further Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 studies are urgently needed to gain deeper insights into the relationship between exercise-induced modulation of IGF-1 release, functional and structural brain changes, and cognitive performance 332, 333. Table 3 Overview of exercise variables and training variables 60, 113, 354–356 Variables for structuring a single resistance exercise session exercise variables i Load amount of weight that is used for an exercise; usually given as a percentage of the one repetition maximum 1RM Homocysteine A possible neurobiological mechanism that elucidates, at least partly, the effects of resistance training on white mat- ter and cognition could be derived from the known effects of resistance training on the amino acid homocysteine. First, it is important to remember that a higher total homocysteine level is linked to i a higher extent of white matter lesions , ii a higher faster brain atrophy rate 335–337, iii an increased risk of neurological dis- eases 338–344, and iv poorer global cognitive perform- ance and executive functioning 345–350. Second, it is known that resistance training decreases the level of plasma and serum homocysteine 187, 352. Hence, it could be speculated that reducing the homocysteine level in response to resistance training may, at least partly, have positive effects on brain structure e.g., white matter changes such as reduced atrophy and/or cognitive func- tions. However, such relationships have not been directly observed in the studies reviewed and have to be in- vestigated in future studies. level Influence of exercise variables and training variables on neurocognition With regard to all studies reviewed, the exercise and training variables of the resistance intervention protocols were chosen as to induce muscle hypertrophy and muscle strength improvements, which is not surprising, as resistance training programs generally focus on im- proving these two factors. Moreover, this observation is consistent with two other reviews summarizing the re- sults of resistance exercise and resistance training stud- ies on outcomes on a behavioral 107, 353. However, given that the dose provided by a physical intervention e.g., resistance exercise or resistance train- ing is a function of exercise variables and training vari- the reviewed studies are relatively ables and that homogenous regarding the selection of exercise variables and training variables, our knowledge about the dose- response relationship in resistance exercise and resist- ance training is relatively meager especially in view of the fact that resistance exercises and resistance training can be designed in many different ways to focus on dif- ferent aims for muscular performance. A deeper under- standing of the dose-response relationship is needed 105, 108, 110 because the dose the design of exercise variables and training variables, see Table 3 is a key fac- tor influencing responsiveness 357, 358 and individual- izing physical interventions 123, 124, 359. ii Number of repetitions iii Number of sets iv Inter-set rest period v Inter-exercise rest period vi Number of exercises for the whole training session or for a muscle or a muscle group with the same function vii Repetition velocity with respect to the conducted resistance exercise and the starting position, temporal details should be given as follows: i.e., biceps curls starting with fully extended arms e.g., bench press starting with fully extended arms: concentric phase eccentric phase – inter-repetition rest periods – eccentric phase concentric phase – rest period up to the start of the next repetition, e.g., 2–0–2–1 s viii Muscle action concentric, eccentric, isometric ix Exercise selection e.g., multi-joint or single-joint exercises x Exercise order e.g., squat, leg extension, biceps curl, and concentration curl or squat, biceps curl, leg extension, and concentration curl xi Volitional muscle failure xii Range of motion Variables for structuring resistance training training variables 1. Frequency number of training sessions per week 2. Density distribution of training sessions across a week with regard to recovery time in-between training sessions 3. Duration duration over which a training program is carried out; e.g., before exercise variables will be changed Please note, that some exercise variables are usually summarized into variables with different designations: e.g., volume exercise variables ii, iii, and iv, time under tension TUT, sum of the exercise variables ii and vii or duration of an exercise session depends on exercise variables ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, and the duration of warm-up and cool-down 354, 356 In the following section, we outline promising starting points for investigating the dose-response relationship in resistance exercise and/or resistance training studies. With regard to load, on the behavioral level, it was ob- served that an acute bout of moderate-load resistance exercises 70 to 100% of the 10RM, 10RM = the load needed for 10 repetitions until maximum exhaustion improves the speed of processing, while resistance exer- cises with low load 40% of the 10RM improve execu- tive functions . Furthermore, it was reported that improvements in executive functions were larger after moderate-load 70% of 10RM than low-load 40% of 10RM resistance exercises . The finding that resist- ance exercises with moderate loads are especially benefi- for cognitive performance is supported by the cial observation that resistance exercises with moderate loads 60% 1RM lead to larger positive effects on higher i.e., Stroop interference score cognitive functions Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 compared with resistance exercises with heavier loads ≥ 75% 1RM . In another study, it was noticed that a single bout of high-load 100% of 10RM resistance exer- cises resulted in less interference and fastened reaction times for the Stroop task 15 min after exercise cessation, while 180 min after exercise cessation, low-load 40% of 10RM and moderate-load 70% of 10RM resistance ex- ercises were associated with increased performance on the plus-minus and the Simon task . However, at the moment, only two studies have employed neuroim- aging methods to investigate the dose-response relation- ship with respect to the exercise load 182, 183. In this study, no statistically significant differences in neuroelec- tric outcomes between conditions were observed 182, 183. Based on the sparse evidence in this area, further research is required to investigate whether such load- dependent cognitive improvements are mirrored in acute processes of the central nervous system e.g., mea- sured prior and after resistance exercises by fNIRS or EEG 201, 360–362. With regard to number of sets, on the behavioral level, it was reported that younger adults performing three or five sets of a resistance exercise showed after a 8-week inter- vention period greater improvements in inhibitory control i.e., assessed by accuracy and mean response time in the Stroop test than younger adults performing one set of the same resistance exercise . Because the above- mentioned study did not apply neuroimaging techniques or quantify neurotrophic markers e.g., BDNF , fu- ture investigations are needed to elucidate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. With regard to frequency, on the behavioral level, resist- ance training three times a week was more efficient than training twice a week . Since most reviewed studies conducted resistance training twice a week 45, 184–186, 189, 190 and observed beneficial results or did not com- pare a training with two sessions per week to other train- ing frequencies 44, 187, the findings of Li et al. are not supported by functional or structural data. Hence, fu- ture studies are required to investigate the influence of training frequency on functional and structural brain changes e.g., one time per week vs. three times per week. Since changes at the molecular and cellular levels e.g., metabolic response, such as peripheral blood lactate concentration are linked to behavioral changes, a prom- ising approach to positively influence neurocognition could be the alteration of molecular and cellular pro- cesses by adjusting the exercise prescription via exercise and training variables. In particular, after an acute bout of physical exercise, postexercise concentrations of peripheral blood lactate were found to be linked to improvements in executive functions 364–366. In this context, peripherally e.g., in the musculature released lactate is expected to be utilized as ‘fuel’ for cognitive processes because it can cross the BBB with the help of monocarboxylate transporters 367– 371. Furthermore, peripheral lactate may trigger the re- lease of serum BDNF 309, 311, 372, but this relationship seems to be highly reliant on the correct selection of re- sistance exercise variables . Notwithstanding, it has been well demonstrated that serum BDNF contributes sig- nificantly to changes in brain structure 21, 24 and per- formance e.g., cognition 21, 305, 306. Consequently, given that the peripheral concentration of blood lactate is a function of resistance exercise variables such as repeti- tion velocity 373, 374 or inter-set rest periods , it seems reasonable to speculate that a purposeful modifica- tion of these exercise variables may also influence neuro- cognition outcomes. Notably, in this context, it was also hypothesized that resistance exercises with blood flow restriction BFR could be beneficial for neurocognition because resistance exercises with BFR or resistance train- ing with BFR induce beneficial processes on a molecular and cellular level for review see . However, further research in this area with a strong focus on underlying neurobiological processes, functional and structural brain changes, and cognition is required. Finally, similar to the major ongoing discussions regard- ing which variables may be optimal to improve muscular adaptions, such as muscle hypertrophy or strength 376– 390, the optimal exercise prescription e.g., exercise vari- ables and training variables for resistance exercises and/ or resistance training with respect to brain health includ- ing appropriate functional and structural brain changes as well as enhancement of cognitive functions are largely unknown and have to be elucidated in future studies 105, 108, 110. In addition, the interested reader may find fur- ther and more detailed information regarding the design of resistance exercise sessions or resistance training in the referenced literature 355, 391–394. Recommendations for future studies cid:1 Based on the available evidence derived from the reviewed studies and other recommendations , resistance exercises and/or resistance training aiming to enhance cognitive functions and evoke positive functional and structural brain changes should be designed to induce muscle hypertrophy. cid:1 Future studies are needed to investigate the influence of the adjustment of different resistance exercise variables e.g., load, number of sets, training frequency, training duration on functional and structural brain changes in conjunction with cognitive functions. cid:1 To understand the time-course of functional and structural brain changes, neuroimaging should be performed at several time points after an acute bout Herold et al. European Review of Aging and Physical Activity 2019 16:10 of resistance exercise or during the resistance training intervention. cid:1 The inclusion of further cohorts e.g., older individuals with sarcopenia and/or dynapenia is needed to verify whether resistance exercise-induced improvements also occur in such needy cohorts and how this is related to functional and structural brain changes. cid:1 Interventional studies or cross-sectional studies investigating the relationship of resistance exercises or strength, muscle function/structure and cognition should utilize different neuroimaging methods during standardized cognitive testing and assess neurochemical substances e.g., neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors to elucidate underlying neurobiological mechanisms. cid:1 Bed rest studies, which reported a worsening of executive functions 395–397, profound brain changes 397–399, and a decrease in muscle mass as well as muscle strength 400–408, could be an interesting model to study the relationship between the muscular system, functional and structural brain changes, and cognition. Conclusions In summary, resistance exercises and resistance training are powerful physical intervention strategies to induce meaningful functional brain changes, especially in the frontal lobe, which are accompanied by improvements in executive functions. Furthermore, based on the stud- ies reviewed, resistance training leads to lower white matter atrophy and lower volumes of white matter le- sions. However, given the small number of available stud- ies that have mostly been part of greater study projects Brain Power Study and SMART Study of Mental and Re- sistance Training, further research investigating the in- fluence of an acute bout of resistance exercise and chronic resistance training on cognition and the underlying neuro- biological mechanisms e.g., functional and/or structural brain changes is needed. This future research should also focus on the effects of systematically manipulating exer- cise and training variables dose-response relationship and further including specific cohorts with the greatest need e.g., older individuals with sarcopenia and/or dyna- penia. Most importantly, engaging regularly in resistance exercises and/or resistance training across the whole life- span appears to be imperative for ensuring physical and brain health because muscular weakness in the early years of life e.g., adolescence has been shown to be associated with disability in later life e.g., after 30 years and even 4 weeks of detraining being physical inactive com- pletely reversed the physical and cognitive improvements of 22-week resistance training in older adults . Hence, to summarize in a metaphorical sense: “May the force be with you across your lifespan.” Acknowledgments The authors have nothing to acknowledge.
