METHODS: We searched 6 databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Magiran, and the Scientific Information Da- tabase from 2000 to the November 2017, using “aged 60 and over,” “physical activity” or “exercise,” and “motivator” and “barrier” as keywords. Two reviewers independently performed the search, screening, and quality assessment of the studies. RESULTS: In total, 34 papers were finally included in the study. The most important barriers, based on the frequency of factors, included physical problems, having no companions, and physical barriers to walking. The motivators included improving one’s physical condition, being social, and suitability of the physical environment. CONCLUSIONS: Important motivators and barriers to PA were more closely related to intrapersonal factors than to the inter- personal and environmental domains. The barriers and motivators to PA in the elderly were not markedly different between Iran and other countries. Therefore, a general strategy could be designed to improve PA in the elderly. KEY WORDS: Motivation, Sedentary behavior, Exercise, Motor activity, Aging On one hand, physical activity PA helps elderly people to im- prove their strength and flexibility, although the most effective type of activity is still unclear . On the other hand, the elderly— due to health problems and insufficient facilities—are more likely to face barriers to access than others . For adults aged 60 and over, important motivations for PA have Correspondence: Ali Ramezankhani Department of Public Health, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Shahid Chamran Highway, Tehran 198353-5511, Iran E-mail: Received: Jun 16, 2019 / Accepted: Nov 29, 2019 / Published: Nov 29, 2019 This article is available from: This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. 2019, Korean Society of Epidemiology been reported to include social support, health benefits, and en- joyment, while the main barriers have been found to be insuffi- cient guidance and a lack of role models . For people aged over reported to be the health benefits of PA, various types of fears, in- dividual preferences, and social support . In general, due to the increasing percentage of the older population in developing low- and middle-income countries and the burden of health care and treatment costs, reducing the prevalence of physical inactivity has received attention as an important goal . In addition, PA devel- ops as a behavior through complex and dynamic interrelations among individual, social, and environmental factors, underscor- ing the usefulness of using multidimensional models to study PA 6,7. As an example of this approach, the socio-ecological model of McLeroy et al. was used to study the barriers and motiva- tions to PA in the elderly. The aim of this study was to systemati- cally review the motivators and barriers to PA in people aged 60 years and older in Iran and other countries. www.e-epih.org | 1 Epidemiol Health 2019;41:e2019049 Search strategy To collect the data, a comprehensive search was performed of several electronic databases PubMed MeSH terms, Web of Sci- ence, Scopus, Embase, Scientific Information Database, Magiran to identify all potentially relevant publications in the Persian and English languages from 2000 to November 2017. The following keywords were used: “aged or age 60 and over,” “physical activity or exercise,” and “motivator and barrier” Supplementary Mate- rial 1. The detailed search strategy implementation in PubMed was as follows: elderly OR Aged OR “60 over aged” AND “Phy- sical activity” OR “Exercise” OR “Physical exercise” OR “Motor activity” AND Motivation OR Motivat OR Barrier. The in- clusion criteria were 1 articles published in the Persian and Eng- lish languages; 2 original research examining the barriers and motivators to PA in the elderly; 3 studies that examined out- comes in terms of physical and mental illness among the elderly aged 60 and over; and 4 studies conducted from from 2000 to November 2017. The exclusion criteria were non-original articles i.e., letters to the editor, case reports, interventional studies, re- views, meta-analyses, and articles presented at seminars and con- ferences were excluded, articles with no specific definition of age, those that were conducted before 2000 but were accepted in 2000 or later, articles analyzing elderly individuals living in nursing homes, and articles with a very low quality score. In addition, a backward search checking bibliographic mining of identified pa- pers for any additional studies was conducted to identify any studies that were not retrieved using the main search strategy. All quantitative and qualitative designs were included. In total, 1,981 articles were retrieved, of which a total of 34 articles remained af- ter the review process shown in Figure 1. Finally, 2 authors care- fully examined 34 full-text articles. In this study, 2 types of studies were investigated: 1 quantita- tive studies 5 from Iran and 15 from other countries; 2 qualita- tive studies 1 from Iran and 13 from other countries. There were 6 studies in Persian and 28 studies in English.

In general, according to the NICE checklist, ++ means that all or most of the checklist criteria have been ful- filled, + means that some of the checklist criteria have been ful- filled, and – means that few or no checklist criteria have been ful- filled. Quantitative studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ot- tawa Quality Assessment Scale NOS adapted for cross-sectional studies . The NOS is based on 3 domains, including the selec- tion of study groups, the comparability of groups, and the descrip- tion of exposures and outcomes. This scale, which includes 8 items is scored in terms of stars, assesses the quality of each study in each domain. All items except the comparability domain have 1 star, while the maximum score for the comparability domain is 2 stars. The total number of earned stars is calculated as the total quality score for each study, which ranges from 1 star very poor to 10 stars high quality. Studies were classified as high-quality 8-10, medium-quality 6-7, or low-quality 6. Two review authors SY and HMS completed the quality assessment inde- pendently. In cases of disagreement or items that remained un- clear, a third review author AR or MG was consulted. Data extraction We used a structured form to extract the data. The extracted data included study and participant characteristics e.g., gender, location, country, population, age, type of instrument, type of study, year of study, as well as motivators and barriers to PA. Two authors SY and HMS, who conducted the study selection inde- pendently, performed the data extraction. Any disagreements Table 1. Quality assessment of qualitative articles Yarmohammadi S et al. : PA in aged adults were discussed with a third review author AR or MG if neces- sary. The data were classified using the socio-ecological model that McLeroy et al. developed in 1988 as a theoretical frame- work involving interpersonal and intrapersonal factors, organiza- tional and social factors, and environmental factors Figure 2. The identified factors were prioritized based on the frequency of participants’ responses. Ethics statement This study is a systematic review and does not deal with human participants.

Two of the 14 quali- tative articles were high-quality, 12 were good-quality, and 5 were poor-quality, as indicated in Table 1. The quantitative studies were evaluated using the NOS scale, and 18 articles were found to be moderate- to high-quality, while 2 were moderate-quality. Description of reviewed studies The articles were published between 2000 and November 2017, and the sample sizes ranged from 9 in a qualitative study to 4,227 participants in a quantitative study. The samples consisted of both men and women subjects in 30 of the 34 studies, exclusively of women subjects in 4 studies, and exclusively of men subjects in swimming and fitness, and a description of the type of PA was not available in 17 studies. In Tables 2 and 3, the characteristics and major findings of the studies are presented. Motivators and barriers to the physical activity among the elderly In the framework of the McLeroy model, we examined the mo- tivators and barriers to PA among the elderly in the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental domains as follows Tables 2 and 3. According to the study population—people aged 60 years and older—the items from the organizational domain of the Mc- Leroy model were excluded. For quantitative studies, only signifi- cant variables were evaluated. Due to the heterogeneity across studies and input variables, it was not possible to conduct a meta- analysis of the results. Below, the most important factors for all dimensions of the model, based on the frequency of participants’ responses, are presented. Intrapersonal factors Through the literature review, 23 barriers and 16 motivators were identified as intrapersonal factors. In several articles, physi- cal problems—such as difficulty in walking, physical health prob- lems, physical weakness, respiratory problems, and lack of ener- gy—were mentioned as key barriers 13,14,16,19,27,31-34,36, 38-41,43-45. Time limits were the second most important barrier related to intrapersonal factors 16,17,19,27,28,35,36,39,42-44.

The most important interpersonal barrier to PA was having no companion 36,42. Family responsibilities tak- ing care of grandchildren, children, and sick people at home were the second most important interpersonal barrier to PA . The most important interpersonal motivator was being social, which included communication with friends, peer support, com- munication with others, exercise with friends, social coherence, moderate and high local dependency, an abundance of compan- ions for walking, and support from others 11,16,18,23,24,26,28, 30,36,40. Supervision of health professionals was the second in- terpersonal motivator 18,28,29. In addition, 3 articles identified specialist health care 18,28,29 as a motivator for PA. Another important interpersonal motivator for PA was the availability of sports facilities 15,24. Environmental factors Overall, 7 barriers and 6 motivators were identified at the com- munity level. The most important barrier was physical barriers to walking, which included problems related to safety, parked mo- torcycles next to the street, potted plants, rubber tiles in playgrounds, food retailers, paved streets, broken sidewalks, scaffolds, snow ac- cumulation along the street in winter, devoted seats in parks for children, the lack of facilities such as benches for resting, poor lo- cations, unsafe roads, stray dogs, and hills 22,23,26,27,31,43,44. The second most important set of barriers were related to tem- perature, season, and weather 16,25,27,34,35. More intense PA among the elderly was observed in the spring 40.1%, in sunny weather 76.8%, and at moderate temperatures 56.2% . The third most important barrier was a lack of facilities for exercise 16,21,34,36. The most important environmental motivator was the suitabil- ity of the physical environment. This factor included pleasant land- scapes, streetlights, sidewalks, bike riding routes, walking paths, the neighborhood’s suitability for walking, interconnections be- tween streets and an attractive environment, an environment free from non-cultural social activities e.g., smoking, drinking alco- hol, gambling, green space, attractive architecture, benches for resting, a place for dog parks, a smooth surface for hiking, and food availability in urban centers 11,23,26,34,36. Environmental security was the second environmental motivator 26,30. In the present study, information on PA among the elderly was reviewed from 2000 to November 2017. We aimed to identify the motivators and barriers to PA among individuals aged over 60 in Iran and worldwide; therefore, some studies were excluded be- cause they did not analyze participants under or over 60 years of age as 2 different groups 2,36. In general, the ecological model is a comprehensive multilevel framework that includes contributors to active behavior at all levels: individual interpersonal and in- | www.e-epih.org trapersonal, social, environmental, and policy . A systematic review by Baert et al. on adults aged over 79 confirmed that quantitative research has a greater focus on the in- terpersonal and community levels, while qualitative research tends to focus more on the interpersonal level. We found that more re- search is needed into barriers and motivators at the organizational level, while Baert et al. showed that community-based barriers and motivators need more research because policy-makers may be able to exert influence on these factors. Intrapersonal factors Health status was highlighted in most articles, either as a barri- er 18 times or as a motivator 5 times for PA. To summarize, in the literature review, 23 articles reported that poor health was a relevant factor for PA among those aged 60 and over. Moreover, the beneficial effects of PA on health status such as improving balance, improving walking ability, reducing muscle pain, im- proving sleep, and strengthening are well established. In addi- tion, Baert et al. reported that health status was both a barrier and motivator. Nonetheless, health improvement has been re- ported as an important motivator, and research has highlighted that health benefits can be a major factor for promoting PA . In this review, most studies were conducted in Iran and the USA. In these countries, special consideration should be given to the proportion of the young population in light of current barriers. For example, since Iran is a country with a young population, the proportion of the elderly in Iran is expected to peak in the next 50 years, and Iran will face similar challenges to Europe and the USA between 2040 and 2050 . Fear emerged as a special barrier. Fear is a complex phenome- non that can occur in different situations e.g., fear of walking at night in order to exercise outside the house. It can be related to health status, such as fear of injury or pain, fear of falling, and fear of being dependent on others. Lim & Taylor reported that fear of falling was associated with inadequate levels of PA. Moreo- ver, fear of falling was identified as a barrier to PA in different rac- es, including African-Americans, Whites, and American Indians. In particular, American Indians were worried about falling when there was nobody to help them . Furthermore, anxiety and fear of injury were mentioned as a barrier . Health care pro- viders should recognize this type of fear, and should consider it as an important barrier to be dealt with appropriately, if necessary. In our study, time limits or lack of time was identified as a bar- rier. This barrier has also been described in other studies . In a focus group study, lack of time among people aged over 65 was found to be a barrier to PA . In many countries and cultures, the responsibilities of taking care of children and the home take up many hours in the day, with consequent negative effects on health behavior . Enjoying PA was reported as a motivator, as in other studies. Fac- tors related to enjoyment increase the pleasure experienced during PA, which depends on individual preferences doing physical exer- cise in a group or enjoying the landscape. Fortunately, health care providers can provide support and guidance in this respect . Interpersonal factors As has been found for other age groups, being social was iden- tified as a motivator. In general, social support was also reported as a motivational factor. However, elderly individuals need more social support than younger adults . Unfortunately, elderly peo- ple are often single, causing them to be socially isolated . Su- pervision by health professionals has an important impact on PA in the elderly; in particular, health care providers can encourage elderly people to participate in group exercises. It has been sug- gested that by providing information and raising awareness about PA, health care providers can augment the self-confidence of el- derly individuals to begin exercise regimens . Environmental factors A lack of sports facilities was considered to be an especially im- portant barrier. In this regard, construction of playgrounds, side- walks, parks, or other fitness facilities could motivate individuals to participate in exercise, such as walking. Governments play an important role in providing subsidies and funding for health fa- cilities, such as health centers and walking paths . It was found that a lack of adequate facilities in organizational settings led to a decrease in enthusiasm for PA . Likewise, in Iran, a study con- firmed that the presence of exercise facilities, parks, and walking or cycling routes increased elderly individuals’ motivation to en- gage in PA . Some studies have shown that the availability of a resting place, such as benches along walking paths, may facilitate walking among the elderly. In this regard, for the elderly, it is very important to ensure easy access to safe, beautiful, and interesting places for walk- ing. For these reasons, the elderly were found to prefer routes with places for them to rest . The weather, season, and temperature were identified as poten- tial barriers. Nadri et al. , in Iran, reported that participants considered an inappropriate environment to be a barrier. In addi- tion, other studies have shown relationships between natural chang- es season, weather, and temperature and the intensity of PA . In general, more intense PA was observed in the spring 40.1%, in sunny weather 76.8%, and at moderate temperatures 56.2%. Elderly individuals were found to engage in more frequent walk- ing in sunny weather than in rainy weather, and their walking rate was higher at temperatures below 60°F than at high temperatures 81°F. Schmidt et al. reported that “unpleasant weather” such as cold, snow, and extreme heat was a barrier. In addition, a study confirmed that the weather was a potential barrier for the oldest old people . It is worth mentioning that we found some similar barriers and motivators. In some reviewed studies, a link was found between the benefits of prayer and PA. The energy cost of Muslim daily prayers was about 80 calories per day, implying that daily prayers could be considered a form of PA 12,54. There are two important implications of these findings. First, Yarmohammadi S et al. : PA in aged adults the factors identified as important herein should be analyzed with regard to gender. Second, it is necessary to consider geographical areas and the accessibility of facilities. Additionally, the type of in- tervention program community- or individual-based is an espe- cially important factor for encouraging the elderly to participate in exercise. This systematic review has the following limitations. First, no information was extracted on differences between men and wom- en. Therefore, further research is needed to identify any such po- tential differences. Second, it is possible that differences existed among participants and authors in the definition of exercise and PA. Third, most studies were conducted in developed countries, which may have yielded country-specific results and decreased the generalizability of the findings. As a final limitation, due to in- consistencies and heterogeneity in the data gathering and analysis methods used in the quantitative articles, it was not feasible to con- duct a meta-analysis. This study presents a comprehensive literature review and anal- ysis on the barriers and motivators to PA in the elderly. Most bar- riers involved the intrapersonal and interpersonal domains. Ac- cording to the population composition of the countries that were analyzed—especially Iran—interventions to address this issue are essential. In addition, the elderly may have different perceptions of barriers and motivators that need to be considered.
