Numerous studies have demonstrated that moderate and vigorous exercise can improve cardiovascular health by reducing risk factors such as hypertension, cholesterol levels, and body weight. This narrative review will explore the epidemiological evidence on the effects of physical activity on various cardiovascular conditions, including ischaemic heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and heart failure. The review will also address potential challenges, such as variations in exercise intensity, frequency, and measurement methods.",
